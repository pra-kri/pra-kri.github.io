### What Should You Work On?

The majority of your life will be spent working. There are countless ways to burn your years away: countless jobs to work, books to read, skills to learn... but only a few will be worth your time. So how do you decide what to focus on? What skills should you pick up? How do you make sure that, when you're older, you won't feel like you aged *wrong*, and wasted years learning dumb sh**.

Maybe the following principles could be helpful. <br>
Choose skills that are: **Admirable, Self-Reliant, Timeless** and **Craft-Like**.

    <td><b>1. Is it ADMIRABLE?</b></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Is it respectable and meaningful to you? Does it help you be a bit more like who you admire? Does the thought of mastering the skill excite you? Then yes - go learn it, 100%. In fact, 'inspiration is perishable' <sup>from Re:Work</sup>, so maybe put everything else aside and focus 100% on this. You learn and create much faster when there is emotional intensity behind your work.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b> Or is it the opposite? Are you bored? Fighting procrastination and 'working hard' like a domesticated lapdog? Maybe you tell yourself that you're being 'disciplined' and you 'work hard', when really you're just too scared to disobediently pursue your own interests. Procrastination might be your body's warning signal: you're rotting your soul and your self-respect if you keep working on this.

    <td><b>2. Is it SELF-RELIANT? </b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b>Is it independent and self-reliant? Can you create value and wealth in entrepreneurial ventures with small teams? ('front office', close-to-the-money, revenue-generating?). Will it help you take risks in the open market? 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or is it a heavily dependent, specialised skill that's useless outside of large corporations? Will it make you fragile and dependent on corporate 'performance' reviews, your manager's opinion, and the whims of the geniuses working in HR departments? Is it a skill that only pays if you offer your obedience to a bigcorp?

    <td><b>3. Is it TIMELESS?</b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Can you compound your knowledge and understanding of the field over decades? Can you pick up real 'wisdom' and experience in the field? Does it have timeless principles that you can apply 20 years into the future?
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or are you learning something that'll be useless in 10 years time? Is it just a dumb fad that you'll eventually forget?

  <tr>
    <td><b>4. Is it CRAFT-LIKE?</b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Are there noticeable skill-gaps between the best and the mediocre? Is there elegance and simplicity in high-quality work? Can you master the craft so that you're better than the competition? Will it reward creativity, skill or contrarian thinking? 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or is the work mostly the same, regardless of who does it? Are you able to teach a 'Gender Studies & Post-Colonial Poetry MSc' grad how to master it in less than 12 months? (or a STEM graduate, in under 3 months?)
