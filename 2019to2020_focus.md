### What Should You Work On?

The majority of your life will be spent working. There are countless ways to burn your years away: countless jobs to work, books to read, skills to learn... but only a few will be worth your time. So how do you decide what to focus on? What skills should you pick up? How do you make sure that, when you're older, you won't feel like you aged *wrong*, and wasted years learning dumb sh**.

Maybe the following principles could be helpful; Choose skills that are:
* **Admirable**
* **Self-Reliant** 
* **Timeless**
* **Craft-Like**. 

##### Principle 1: Is it ADMIRABLE?
* Is it respectable and meaningful to you? Does it help you be a bit more like your heroes? Then yes, maybe it's worth learning.
* Or is it the opposite? Are you bored? Are you fighting procrastination and 'working hard' like a mechanised nerd? Procrastination might be your body's way of warning you: you're slowly rotting your soul, or at least the neural regions where your soul crackles around in.

##### Principle 2: Is it SELF-RELIANT? 
* Is it useful, independent, and self-reliant? Can you create a lot of value and wealth in entrepreneurial ventures, with small teams? ('front office', close-to-the-money, revenue-generating?). Will it help you take risks in the open market?
* Or is it a heavily dependent, specialised skill that's useless outside of large corporations? Will it make you extremely fragile and dependent on corporate 'performance' reviews, your manager's opinion, and the whims of the geniuses working in HR departments?

##### Principle 3: Is it TIMELESS?
* Can you compound your knowledge and understanding of the field over many decades? Can you pick up 'wisdom' in the field? Does it have timeless core principles? 
* Or are you learning something that'll be useless in 10 years time? Is it just a dumb fad?

##### Principle 4: Is it CRAFT-LIKE? 
* Are there noticeable skill-gaps between the best and the mediocre? Is there a fair amount of elegance and simplicity in high-quality work? Can you master the craft so that you're better than the competition, and your work is more elegant? Will it reward creativity, skill or contrarian thinking?
* Or is the work mostly the same, regardless of who does it? Are you able to teach a 'Gender Studies & Post-Colonial Poetry MSc' grad how to master it in less than 6 months?
