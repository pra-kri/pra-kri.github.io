### What Should You Work On?

The majority of your life will be spent working. There are countless ways to burn your years away: too many things to study and work on. So how do you decide what to focus on? What skills should you pick up? How do you make sure that, when you're older, you won't feel like you aged *wrong*, and wasted years working on dumb sh**.

Maybe the following principles could be helpful. <br>
Choose skills that are: **Admirable, Self-Reliant, Timeless** and **Craft-Like**.

    <td><b>1. Is it ADMIRABLE?</b></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Follow your emotions. Is it respectable and meaningful to you? Does it help you be a bit more like your heroes? Does it excite you? Then yes - go for it. 'Inspiration is perishable', so maybe put everything else aside and focus 100% on this. You are more productive when there is emotional intensity behind your work, and what you learn stays with you.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b> Or is it the opposite? Are you bored? Fighting procrastination and 'working hard' like a domesticated lapdog? Maybe you tell yourself that you're being 'disciplined' and you 'work hard', but really you're just too scared to disobediently pursue your own interests. Procrastination might be your body's warning signal: you're rotting your soul and your self-respect if you keep working on this for too long.

    <td><b>2. Is it SELF-RELIANT? </b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b>Is it independent and self-reliant? Can you create value and wealth in entrepreneurial ventures with small teams? ('front office', close-to-the-money, revenue-generating?). Will it help you take risks in the open market? 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or is it a heavily dependent, specialised skill that's useless outside of large corporations? Will it make you fragile and dependent on corporate 'performance' reviews, your manager's opinion, and the whims of the geniuses working in HR departments? Is it a skill that only pays if you offer your obedience to a bigcorp?

    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Can you compound your knowledge and understanding of the field over decades? Can you pick up real 'wisdom' and experience in the field? Does it have timeless principles that you can apply 20 years into the future?
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or are you learning something that'll be useless in 10 years time? Is it just a dumb fad that you'll eventually forget?

    <td><b>4. Is it CRAFT-LIKE?</b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Are there noticeable skill-gaps between the best and the mediocre? Is there elegance and simplicity in high-quality work? Can you master the craft so that you're better than the competition? Will it reward creativity, skill or contrarian thinking? 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or is the work mostly the same, regardless of who does it? Are you able to teach a 'Gender Studies & Post-Colonial Poetry MSc' grad how to master it in less than 12 months? (or a STEM graduate, in under 6 months?)

### What exactly does 'Admirable' mean in this case? 
A lot of your personal heroes are great writers, professors and entrepreneurs: men who were wise, knowledgable, and courageous enough to take risks for their opinions. Many had contrarian or socially unacceptable views that they bet their time, money and reputation on. Some even risked their lives for 'dangerous' opinions under totalitarian and fascist governments. 
<br>
In a way, they followed the Socratic ideal of <b>taking risks and paying a price for their opinions</b>. They weren't risk-averse nerd who hid in the library, afraid to make sacrifices. But they also weren't blind risk-takers. They had both courage and wisdom - the willingness to seek risk and danger for the right reasons, but also manage the risk carefully. 
<br>
You should aim to live up to those standards. Sure, that might sound cheesy and overly idealistic. But there's a reason why you have an instinct for admiration ingrained in your biology, the same way that loyalty and respect are deeply ingrained in packs-animals like wolves and chimpanzees. It's not a silly emotion to ignore and relegate to fiction. If you don't take your 'admiration instinct' seriously, you might end up just like the pudgy cowards who never take risks for their opinions. The men who sit in their cushy office jobs with no real meaningful contribution to their community, who then spend the rest of their time as consumerist experts, probably to keep nihilism and exitential dread at bay. Maybe that's arrogant and too opinionated, but it sure as hell beats becoming just like them. (That right there was another anti-ideal. Reminder; you will piss off a lot of people with this crap, but the filtration mechanism will help you find teams and co-founders/co-workers with similar mindsets. You'll have to pay a price for all this arrogance though...)

TODO:::

* **Contrarian clarity of thought; BS-detection; Knowing what dumb sh\*t to ignore** - filtering the unknown (signal vs noise)
* **Wisdom, Epistemic Humility** - respecting the unknown.
* **Courage, Risk-taking, playful unruly disobedient hunting of opportunities (not cheap obedience)** -  chasing/exploring the unknown
