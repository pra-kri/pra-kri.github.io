### The Skills, Knowledge.
<br>
##### 1. Writing
Become a skilled writer with clarity and depth. Cut through the useless noise to get to the central principles. 
Write essays; explore interesting, idiosyncratic topics.
BAD: Learn all about bad writing. What do bad writers do? Fill their sentences with fluff and unneccesarily big words because
they have nothing of value to actually say. Talk about boring topics, never diverge into interesting observations. No surprises.

##### 2. SICP 
Read and master all the content in The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. Learn how to be a 'great hacker'.
Build clean, elegant systems.
BAD: Learn what crappy hackers do. Learn all the ways they fail to hide complexity, and all the ways that screw technical decisions.
Look around and try to work with some really crappy code. Really feel how tedious and unnecessarily complex it is. 
Read spaghetti code and lasagne code. Read code written by shitty developers with no clarity of thought. Read code written by 
developers who were rushed too quickly. Read your own code and criticize it.

##### 3. R&D - Probability, Information, ML
Build a deep, intuitive understanding of randomness, uncertainty, information and prediction - from a technical, quant. perspective.
Learn how to use the techniques appropriately and quickly in R&D. Cut to the core of the material and really make an effort at
getting the intuition behind the techniques. Try to understand ML from a Probabilistic and Information-Theoretic lens. 
And learn all the real-world applications.
BAD: Learn how all the idiots get tricked by statistics and machine learning. (e.g. social scientists, policy makers...etc)
Find out all the ways liars can manipulate statistical + ML models. 

##### 4. Investing, VC, £££, Entrepreneurship, Strategy
Build a deep understanding of investing + allocation of productive capital in a free market. What signals can be used to predict growth in companies? Quality of founders, quality of management, fundamental analysis, quant analysis, macroeconomic analysis...?
Valuation (Damodaran, McKinsey book), Startups & Venture Capital (Zero to One, Paul Graham's essays, Tim Ferriss' interviews with HF and VC guys)
Hedge Funds (Taleb, Spitznagel, Dalio, Thorp, Munger, Buffett).
BAD: And, learn how bad investors don't manage their risk. Learn how they lose money, and all the dumb mistakes they make.

##### 5. Policy, Risk, Governance
Understand and study all the trade-offs and risks associated with large-scale, centralised decisions in different fields. 
Be an educated voter and citizen, basically. Political, Medical, Economic decisions are all important. 
And sometimes, naïve idiots introduce massive amounts of systemic risk while thinking they're 'heroic' (usually lefties, for some reason). 
Understand all of it.
BAD: Don't be like those naive idiots who don't understand 2nd order consequences. Those idiots don't take systemic risk seriously, and rarely understand the concept of a trade-off (or *sacrifice* - as it's called from an ethical perspective).
You might occasionally hear them say things that strangely resemble: 'Brexit is bad and racist hurr durr look at me I'm so virtuous'. But then you actually ask them why the EU is so great, and they start stuttering nervously about marginal economic benefits that the EU brings (paid for by money that the UK pays into the EU in the first place...). Cowards. Willing to sell sovereignity because apparently the EU is 'great'.
Maybe these morons would even sell sovereignity to the US, if they offered us 6% extra GDP? 'hurr durr the economy'.
I've found that these are the same idiots who may sometimes mention phrases like 'but that wasn't real communism maaan', or 'hurr durr pay gap so womens are still oppressed', without looking at any issue in depth. Cowards who tend to sell sovereignity and freedom for comfort. Or maybe it's just cheap signalling of virtue? 
'Oh the Gulags? Oh the Nazi concentration camps? Systemic risk? Corruption? Mass surveilance? Genocide? Totalitarianism? 
Naaaa duuude. Those things will *never* happen here. That's why I voted for more government power over all these issues - because I believe in fairness and equality and happy feelings. Big daddy gov will always protect us.' - said the sheep who sold freedom for comfort, moments before being sent to a gulag.
