title: 2019/2020 - Focus - II
---

Focus on these skills. They all follow these principles quite well: Admirable, Timeless, Self-Reliant, Craft-Like.

Via Negativa: learn what *NOT* to do. Have an image of who you *don't* want to end up like: an 'anti-ideal'. It will be just as useful and motivating as having a positive ideal to chase. Sure, it might be quite antagonistic and arrogant, but that's fine. At least you'll be much less likely to end up like the anti-ideals. 

It's OK if you do not reach the heights of the ideals. But its not really acceptable to make the dumb choices and mistakes that your anti-ideals make. Maybe this is one area of life where disdain and arrogance can really be used productively.

    <td><b>1. Writing</b></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Become a skilled writer with clarity, depth and idiosyncracy. Cut through the useless noise; get to the central ideas. Write essays. Explore interesting, important and sometimes controversial topics. Have interesting, well-developed opinions. To be honest, this skill is less about writing itself, and more about clarity of thought. Erudition and ownership of your own opinions: that's the target.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b> Don't be one of those idiots who have nothing interesting to say. The types who can't write or think well, and fill their words with empty fluff. Maybe it's because they have nothing of value to say. Maybe they have underdeveloped opinions and just think what they're told to think - <i>'useful idiots'</i>. No individuality in their perspective whatsoever. Intellectual sheep who conform.

    <td><b>2. Statistical Modelling </b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Build a deep, intuitive understanding of randomness, uncertainty, information and prediction - from a quantitative perspective. Study at the intersection of Probability Theory, Information Theory and Machine Learning. Learn how to apply the techniques effectively in R&D and entrepreneurship: applications that are 'close to the money' or close to useful discoveries.  
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Study all the ways that people get tricked and lied to, through deceptive statistics and machine learning models. Find out how both idiots and liars can manipulate decisions through misleading quantitative models.

    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Read and master the ideas in 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs'. Learn how to be a 'great hacker'. Learn how to build clean, elegant systems. You don't have to be the best software architect; just remember the value you can add to a team or project if you know how to architect and design a system properly.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Learn what crappy and mediocre hackers do. Look at all the ways they fail to hide complexity. Look at all the ways you can screw up technical decisions and exponentially slow productivity. Read 'spaghetti code'. Read 'lasagne code'. Read crappy documentation. Read code written by sh**ty developers with no clarity of thought, or inexperienced developers who were rushed. In fact, read your own code and criticise it (harshly)...

    <td><b>4. Investing, VC, Capital Allocation</b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Build a deep understanding of investing. Where should you allocate capital (and time) in a free market? What signals can you use to predict growth and value in companies? Founder quality, fundamental analysis, quant analysis, macro...etc.? Learn from investors in different fields. Value (Buffett, Munger, Klarman...), VC (Paul Graham, Peter Thiel - Zero to One, Tim Ferriss' interviews with a LOT of angel investors), Quant Traders (Taleb, Spitznagel, Thorp, AQR, Winton,...), Global Macro (Dalio, Soros)...etc 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Learn how all the bad investors lose money. How should you *NOT* manage your risk? Find all the ways that mediocre portfolio managers manage their investments. And for startups, learn how to tell when a startup looks crap: what signals should you watch out for? This is useful both from an investing perspective *and* a startup joiner perspective.

    <td><b>5. Policy, Risk, Governance</b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Study the trade-offs, risks and 2nd order consequences associated with large-scale, centralised decisions in different fields. Be an educated voter and citizen, basically. Political, medical, economic decisions are all important. Epistemic humility and awareness of risk might be the key here.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Don't be like those naive idiots who introduce massive amounts of systemic risk through dumb policies, while thinking they're 'heroic'. Usually done by lefties for some reason... These types of idiots rarely seem to understand systemic risk and 2nd order consequences. They don't seem to grasp the concept of 'trade-off' (or *sacrifice* - as you might call it from an ethical lens). You might occasionally hear them say colourful statements like "Brexit is bad and racist hurr durr 2nd referendum plsss. im so virtuous look at me". And then if you ask them why they think the EU is so great, they might start stuttering nervously about marginal economic benefits that the EU brings, and claim that everyone who voted for Brexit is clearly racist and unintelligent. And the whole time they think they're smart and virtuous. Cowards. Willing to sell sovereignity for some money. Maybe these morons would sell sovereignity, border-control and regulatory power to the US, if they offerred us an extra 6% extra GDP? 'hurr durr the economy'. I've found that these are also the same idiots who may occasionally mention phrases like "but that wasn't real communism maaaaan" or "hurr durr pay gap womens are still oppressed by the patriarchy" without looking at any issues and statistics in depth. Cowards who tend to sell liberty for comfort. <br>
      'Oh the Gulags? Oh the Nazi concentration camps? Systemic risk? Corruption? Genocide? Totalitarianism? Naaaa duuuude, those things will *never* happen here. That's why I voted for more government power - because I'm so generous and I care about the oppressed. Big daddy gov will protect us all' - said the sheep who sold freedom for comfort, moments before being sent to a gulag.
