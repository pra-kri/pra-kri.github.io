<p class="message">
  This page is a personal reminder on how to spend time studying during your MSc:<br>
  <ul>
    <li> You get to be a student for 12 months again: you can study anything, as long as you get passing grades.</li>
    <li> So how do you <b>maximise</b> the amount of time learning about things that you <b>actually care about</b>?</li>
    <li> And how do you <b>minimise</b> the amount of time memorising <b>tedious details that you need to pass exams</b>?</li>
  </ul>
</p>

## Coursework > Exams
* Term 1 coursework makes up **25.00%** of the degree. (*25! Important to do well here... 1st term...*)
* Term 2 coursework makes up **13.33%** of the degree. (*13... Can almost ignore...*)
* Term 3 final exams make up **28.33%** of the degree. 
* Term 2,3++ dissertation is **33.33%** of the degree. (*33! Really important. Pick a cool topic then.)
* All of this means: **70+%** of the degree is coursework/dissertation related. 
* Which means that a deep understanding of the core principles, and writing code/reports/papers with clarity and interesting observations will get you most of your marks. *NOT* bland, mechanical, nerd-like memorisation of facts. 

## Interesting Knowledge
Knowledge should be deeply aligned with your personality and interests - not some isolated bunch of facts that you memorise for exams. 
* **Mostly, you want to learn how to make decisions under uncertainty, and make independent, contrarian bets.**
* **And you want to become a good writer with clarity and depth - both with essays and with code.** 

That's all, really. <br>
