<p class="message">
  Notes and reminders: How should you spend time during your MSc?
  
  <ul>
  <li>Mostly, you want to pick up knowledge to help you make decisions under uncertainty, and make independent, contrarian bets.</li>
  <li>And you want to become better at writing: <i>essays, research papers and code</i>.</li>
  <li>You're not really there for the grades or qualifications - you know how little it matters once you have your undergrad degree anyways.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<details><summary> <b>Strategy Note 1: Coursework > Exams:</b> <sub>...(Read more) </sub></summary>
<ul>
  <li> Term 1 coursework makes up **25.00%** of the degree. (<i>25! Important to do well here... 1st term...</i>)</li>
  <li> Term 2 coursework makes up **13.33%** of the degree. (<i>13... Can almost ignore...</i>)</li>
  <li> Term 3 final exams make up **28.33%** of the degree. </li>
  <li> Term 2,3++ dissertation is **33.33%** of the degree. (<i>33! Really important. Pick a cool topic then.</i>)</li>
  <li> All of this means: **70+%** of the degree is coursework/dissertation related. </li>
  <li> Which means that a deep understanding of the core principles, and writing code/reports/papers with clarity and interesting observations will get you most of your marks. *NOT* bland, mechanical, nerd-like memorisation of facts. </li>
</ul>
</details>

<details><summary> <b>Strategy Note 2: Knowledge > Grades</b> <sub>...(Read more) </sub></summary>
  You want knowledge that will...:
<ul>
  <li> Help you make decisions under uncertainty and risk. </li>
  <li> Help you self-reliantly take risks in the market </li>
  <li> Help you filter out the noise to get to the signal. </li>
</ul>
  Which means you should pick only topics that help you get to this goal: topics with lots of probability theory, information theory, machine learning and maybe a bit of complexity and game theory. Things that you are <i>excited</i> to learn. Otherwise, don't do it. Don't pick any topics just because they're easy. Choose them only if you're curiosu. And if there's a really crappy compulsory topic but it doesn't help you get to your goals, and it's only like 2% of the entire syllabus, it might actually be a good idea to skim it quickly and then ignore it. That'll keep you motivated with the rest of the course, and maybe you could spend that time on something more interesting, like a personal project, or something non-academic... Sacrificing 2% of your marks for a much more enjoyable year might be a genuinely good idea. Place your focus on curiosity and knowledge, not on grades.
