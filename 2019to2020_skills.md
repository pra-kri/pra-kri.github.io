title: 2019/2020 - Skills
---

You don't have the time or intelligence to master everything. And if you tried, you would probably neglect all other aspects of your life and start to regret it. So focus only on mastering skills that follow the principles below.

**Ideally, knowledge should be powerful**; it should help you become a better decision maker under risk and uncertainty; it should help you gain control over your own time so you can sacrifice that time for what you deeply care about; it should develop your character and make your conversations more colourful; it should make your life more interesting and meaningful and give you more opportunities to be a bit more like the men you admire. 

**And what if it's not like that?** What if the stuff you learn has none of these qualities? Then stop calling it 'knowledge'. Call it out for what it really is: sh\*\*\*y trivia; tedious work that you're focusing on because you don't have the skills or value to do what you want, so you're going to do what the f\*\*\* you're told to do, obediently and politely at the expense of your self-respect. Have fun.

    <td><b>1. Self-Reliance</b><br><sup>(Courage: taking risks under uncertainty)</sup></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>Useful in small teams + entrepreneurial ventures; Allows risk-taking (<i>~courage</i>) ...<i>(Read more)</i></sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Is it independent and self-reliant? Can you create value and wealth in entrepreneurial ventures with small teams? ('front-office', close-to-the-money, revenue-generating?). Will it help you take risks and chase opportunities in the open market? Does it help you gain ownership of your own time and wealth? In other words, does the knowledge help you become more <i><b>self-owned and courageous</b></i> in the world? 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or is it a heavily dependent, specialised skill that's useless outside of large corporations? Will it make you fragile and dependent on corporate 'performance' reviews, your manager's opinion, and the whims of the geniuses working in HR departments? Is it a skill that only pays if you offer your obedience and 'hard work' to a bigcorp? Will you end up like those idiots who are proud of how many <i>hours</i> they spend working obediently, rather than the value they create? I've found that these are usually the passive types who longingly look forward to the weekends, holidays and (on a longer scale) retirement - almost as if they treat work as something to be tolerated through passive slave-like obedience. These are probably also the types who say they want a certain job, but never work on relevant personal projects in their free time: almost as if they are waiting for a chance to obey, and only then will they actually do the work to see if they enjoy it. But maybe that's also because the skills that you can use in personal 1-man projects are, by default, self-reliant. If you have no self-reliant skills and need the support-structure of a corporation, you'll never really be able to do any personal projects or 'spec-work' for potential clients.

    <td><b>2. Epistemic Humility</b><br><sup>(Wisdom: managing risks under uncertainty)</sup></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>Can compound knowledge and experience for decision-making over time (<i>~wisdom</i>) ...<i>(Read more)</i></sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Does it help you make better decisions under uncertainty? Will it help you mitigate and appropriately handle risk? A few indicators that might help: Does it have timeless principles that will stay true for decades? A lot of timeless knowledge is heavily linked to uncertainty, risk and decision-making, where it usually ends up being called 'wisdom'. In your 40s and 50s, if you learn the right stuff, will your knowledge and voice be respected and taken seriously? Knowledge should make you better at handling the unknown: <i><b>wisdom, decision-making, epistemic humility</b></i>.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or are you learning something that'll be useless in 10 years time? Is it just a dumb fad that you'll eventually forget? Are you learning something that requires no respect for the unknown? Something that demands no epistemic humility and thought? When you're older, will a bunch of arrogant 23-year-olds (just like you right now) know as much as 50-year-old-you about the subject? Will you end up like some of those older guys with no wisdom to impart, because they wasted too much time learning dumb sh\*t? Also, notice the interesting link between courage and wisdom: if you never have the courage to venture into uncertain territory and make your own mistakes, you'll never pick up much personal wisdom and experience. From a nerdy mathematical perspective, Wisdom may be seen as something like the first integral of Courage over time. Personal experience seems to agree: you learnt the most from the actions that you were originally scared to take, and the difficult conversations you were scared to have.

    <td><b>3. Clarity of Thought</b><br><sup>('BS-Detection': filtering signals vs noise, under uncertainty)</sup></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>Rewards creativity, independent thought and contrarianism (<i>~clarity of thought</i>) ...<i>(Read more)</i></sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Is there elegance, clarity and simplicity in high-quality decisions and work? Does it reward skill, creativity or contrarian thinking? Can you progress much faster if you think clearly and independently? Linked to 'wisdom' since that also involves clarity of thought, but wisdom focuses more on risk-management and conservative decision-making, while this principle is focused more on creativity and contrarian unruliness. Can you sift through the useless noise to get to the important, central principles - the signal? How else can you compete against the experienced veterans in the industry, when you're just an arrogant 23-year-old? How else can you outclass the 'hard-working' idiots who throw sheer numbers of hours at their problems? 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or is the work output mostly the same, regardless of who does it and how much clarity of thought goes into it? Two interesting questions. <i>The 'Grad Question': </i>Are you able to teach a 'Gender Studies & Post-Colonial Lesbian Poetry MSc' grad how to fully master it in less than 12 months? (or a STEM graduate, in under 3 months?). <i>The 'Hangover Question': </i>Can you output high quality work with a splitting hangover? If you answered 'yes' to either of these questions, it's probably a sh***y excuse of a 'skill'.

And, focus on this idea: Learn what *not* to do. Have an image of the idiots who you *don't* want to end up like: an **'Anti-Ideal'**. Sure, that's antagonistic and arrogant. But that's OK - at least you'll be less likely to end up like them. It's OK to fail to reach the heights of your ideals - it's supposed to be difficult. But it's not acceptable to make the dumb choices that your anti-ideals make. This is one area of life where disdain and arrogance *might* be healthy.

    <td><b>1. Writing</b></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Become a skilled writer with clarity, depth and idiosyncracy. Cut through the useless noise; get to the central ideas. Write essays. Explore interesting, important and controversial topics. Actually have interesting, well-developed opinions and convictions. To be honest, you should care less about writing itself, but more about clarity of thought. Erudition and ownership of your own opinions: that's the target. Writing is just a way to practice this.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b> Don't be one of those idiots who have nothing interesting to say: the types who can't write or think well, and fill their words with empty fluff. Maybe they have underdeveloped opinions and obediently think what they're told to think - <i>'useful idiots'</i>. No individuality in their perspective whatsoever. Intellectual sheep who conform.

    <td><b>2. Computational + Statistical Modelling </b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Build a deep, intuitive understanding of randomness, uncertainty, information and prediction - from a quantitative and computational perspective. <b>Probability Theory, Information Theory, Machine Learning, Complexity</b>. Focus less on theory, and more on proper application in R&D and entrepreneurship: fields that are 'close to the money'. Practice > Theory.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Study all the ways that people get tricked and lied to, by deceptive statistics and machine learning models. Find out how both idiots and liars can manipulate decisions through misleading quantitative models and stupid assumptions.

    <td><b>3. Investing, VC, Capital Allocation</b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Build a deep understanding of investing. Where should you allocate capital (and time) in a free market? What signals can you use to predict growth and value in companies? Learn from investors in different fields. Value (Buffett, Munger, Klarman...), VC (Paul Graham, Peter Thiel - Zero to One, Tim Ferriss' interviews with a LOT of angel investors), Quant Traders (Taleb, Spitznagel, Thorp, AQR, Winton,...), Global Macro (Dalio, Soros)...etc 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Learn how all the bad investors lose money. How should you *NOT* manage your risk? Find all the ways that mediocre portfolio managers manage their investments. And for startups, learn how to tell when a startup looks crap: what signals should you watch out for? This might also be useful when deciding on which startup to join.

    <td><b>4. Policy, Risk, Governance</b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Study the trade-offs, risks and 2nd order consequences associated with large-scale, centralised decisions in different fields. Be an educated voter and citizen, basically. Political, medical, economic decisions are all important. Epistemic humility and awareness of risk might be the key here.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Don't be like those naive idiots who introduce massive amounts of systemic risk through dumb policies. Usually done by lefties for some reason... These types of idiots rarely seem to understand systemic risk and 2nd order consequences. They don't seem to grasp the concept of 'trade-off' (or *sacrifice* - as you might call it from an ethical lens). You might occasionally hear them say colourful statements like "Brexit is bad and racist hurr durr 2nd referendum plsss. im so virtuous look at me". And then if you ask them why they think the EU is so great, they might start stuttering nervously about marginal economic benefits that the EU brings, and claim that everyone who voted for Brexit is clearly racist and unintelligent. And the whole time they think they're smart and virtuous. Cowards. Willing to sell sovereignity for some money. Maybe these morons would sell sovereignity, border-control and regulatory power to the US, if they offerred us an extra 6% extra GDP? 'hurr durr the economy'. I've found that these are also the same idiots who may occasionally mention phrases like "but that wasn't real communism maaaaan" or "hurr durr pay gap! womens are still oppressed by the patriarchy" without looking at any issues and statistics in depth. Cowards who tend to sell liberty for comfort. <br><br>
      'Oh the Gulags? Oh the Nazi concentration camps? Systemic risk? Corruption? Genocide? Totalitarianism? Naaaa duuuude, those things will *never* happen here. That's why I voted for more government power - because I'm so generous and I care about the oppressed. Big daddy gov will protect us all' - said the sheep who sold freedom for comfort, moments before being sent to a gulag.

      <b> Ideal: </b> Master the ideas in 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs'. Learn how to be a 'great hacker'. You don't have to be the best software architect; just remember the value you can add to a team or project if you know how to architect and design clean, elegant systems.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Learn what crappy and mediocre hackers do. Look at all the ways they fail to hide complexity, and screw up technical decisions to exponentially slow productivity. Read 'spaghetti code'. Read 'lasagne code'. Read crappy documentation. Read code written by sh**ty developers with no clarity of thought, or inexperienced developers who were rushed. In fact, read your own code and criticise it (harshly). Again, you don't have to write the greatest software - just don't make stupid, irreversible decisions that exponentially slow you down.
