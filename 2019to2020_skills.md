title: 2019/2020 - Skills
---

You don't really have the time or intelligence to master everything. And even if you tried, you would end up neglecting other aspects of life and really start to regret it. So focus only on mastering skills that follow these principles. Unless there's good reason, steer clear of all the other skills you can learn. **Ideally, knowledge should be powerful**; it should help you become a better decision maker under risk and uncertainty; it should help you gain control over your own time and wealth; it should make your life more interesting and give you more opportunities. 

If it does the opposite, then you should ask yourself this: Is it true 'knowledge'? Or is it just bland noise that you've been tricked into caring about?

    <td><b>1. Self-Reliant</b></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>Useful in small teams + entrepreneurial ventures; Allows independence and risk-taking (<i>~courage</i>) ...<i>(Read more)</i></sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Is it independent and self-reliant? Can you create value and wealth in entrepreneurial ventures with small teams? ('front-office', close-to-the-money, revenue-generating?). Will it help you take risks and chase opportunities in the open market? Does it help you gain ownership of your own time and wealth? In other words, does the knowledge help you become more <i><b>self-owned and courageous</b></i> in the world? 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or is it a heavily dependent, specialised skill that's useless outside of large corporations? Will it make you fragile and dependent on corporate 'performance' reviews, your manager's opinion, and the whims of the geniuses working in HR departments? Is it a skill that only pays if you offer your obedience and 'hard work' to a bigcorp? Will you end up like those idiots who are proud of how many <i>hours</i> they spend working obediently, rather than how much value they bring to the firm? I've found that these are usually the passive types who longingly look forward to the evenings, weekends and (on a longer scale) retirement - almost as if they treat work as something to be tolerated through passive slave-like obedience.

    <td><b>2. Timeless + Wise</b></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>Timeless, central principles; Can compound knowledge and experience over time (<i>~wisdom</i>) ...<i>(Read more)</i></sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Does it have timeless, core principles that will always be valuable? Can you compound your knowledge and understanding over decades? Will your decision-making capabilities improve over time? <b>A lot of timeless and compounding knowledge has a lot to do with risk and decision-making under uncertainty.</b> In your 40s and 50s, if you learn the right stuff, will your knowledge and voice be respected and taken seriously? Will it make you a <i><b>wiser decision-maker, with epistemic humility</b></i>?
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or are you learning something that'll be useless in 10 years time? Is it just a dumb fad that you'll eventually forget? Are you learning something that requires no respect for the unknown? Something that demands no epistemic humility and thought? When you're older, will a bunch of arrogant 23-year-olds (just like you right now) know as much as 50-year-old-you about the subject?

    <td><b>3. Craft-Like</b></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>Rewards skill, creativity and sometimes contrarianism (<i>~clarity of thought</i>) ...<i>(Read more)</i></sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Are there noticeable skill-gaps between the best and the mediocre? Is there elegance and simplicity in high-quality work? Can you master the craft so that you're better than the competition? Will it reward creativity, skill or contrarian thinking? Can you progress much faster if you think clearly and independently? And if it's craft-like, you should be able to build  yourself a reputation for high-quality work.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or is the work mostly the same, regardless of who does it? Are you able to teach a 'Gender Studies & Post-Colonial Poetry MSc' grad how to master it in less than 12 months? (or a STEM graduate, in under 3 months?) If you answered 'yes' to that question, then it's probably a sh***y 'craft'.

And, focus on this idea: Learn what *not* to do. Have an image of the idiots who you *don't* want to end up like: an **'Anti-Ideal'**. 

Sure, that's antagonistic and arrogant, but that's OK. At least you'll be less likely to end up like them. It's OK to fail to reach the heights of your ideals - it's supposed to be difficult. But it's not acceptable to make the dumb choices and mistakes that your anti-ideals make. This is one area of life where disdain and arrogance might be healthy.

    <td><b>1. Writing</b></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Become a skilled writer with clarity, depth and idiosyncracy. Cut through the useless noise; get to the central ideas. Write essays. Explore interesting, important and controversial topics. Actually have interesting, well-developed opinions and convictions. To be honest, you should care less about writing itself, but more about clarity of thought. Erudition and ownership of your own opinions: that's the target. Writing is just a way to practice this.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b> Don't be one of those idiots who have nothing interesting to say: the types who can't write or think well, and fill their words with empty fluff. Maybe they have underdeveloped opinions and obediently think what they're told to think - <i>'useful idiots'</i>. No individuality in their perspective whatsoever. Intellectual sheep who conform.

    <td><b>2. Computational + Statistical Modelling </b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Build a deep, intuitive understanding of randomness, uncertainty, information and prediction - from a quantitative and computational perspective. <b>Probability Theory, Information Theory, Machine Learning, Complexity</b>. Focus less on theory, and more on proper application in R&D and entrepreneurship: fields that are 'close to the money'. Practice > Theory.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Study all the ways that people get tricked and lied to, by deceptive statistics and machine learning models. Find out how both idiots and liars can manipulate decisions through misleading quantitative models and stupid assumptions.

    <td><b>3. Investing, VC, Capital Allocation</b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Build a deep understanding of investing. Where should you allocate capital (and time) in a free market? What signals can you use to predict growth and value in companies? Learn from investors in different fields. Value (Buffett, Munger, Klarman...), VC (Paul Graham, Peter Thiel - Zero to One, Tim Ferriss' interviews with a LOT of angel investors), Quant Traders (Taleb, Spitznagel, Thorp, AQR, Winton,...), Global Macro (Dalio, Soros)...etc 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Learn how all the bad investors lose money. How should you *NOT* manage your risk? Find all the ways that mediocre portfolio managers manage their investments. And for startups, learn how to tell when a startup looks crap: what signals should you watch out for? This might also be useful when deciding on which startup to join.

    <td><b>4. Policy, Risk, Governance</b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Study the trade-offs, risks and 2nd order consequences associated with large-scale, centralised decisions in different fields. Be an educated voter and citizen, basically. Political, medical, economic decisions are all important. Epistemic humility and awareness of risk might be the key here.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Don't be like those naive idiots who introduce massive amounts of systemic risk through dumb policies. Usually done by lefties for some reason... These types of idiots rarely seem to understand systemic risk and 2nd order consequences. They don't seem to grasp the concept of 'trade-off' (or *sacrifice* - as you might call it from an ethical lens). You might occasionally hear them say colourful statements like "Brexit is bad and racist hurr durr 2nd referendum plsss. im so virtuous look at me". And then if you ask them why they think the EU is so great, they might start stuttering nervously about marginal economic benefits that the EU brings, and claim that everyone who voted for Brexit is clearly racist and unintelligent. And the whole time they think they're smart and virtuous. Cowards. Willing to sell sovereignity for some money. Maybe these morons would sell sovereignity, border-control and regulatory power to the US, if they offerred us an extra 6% extra GDP? 'hurr durr the economy'. I've found that these are also the same idiots who may occasionally mention phrases like "but that wasn't real communism maaaaan" or "hurr durr pay gap! womens are still oppressed by the patriarchy" without looking at any issues and statistics in depth. Cowards who tend to sell liberty for comfort. <br><br>
      'Oh the Gulags? Oh the Nazi concentration camps? Systemic risk? Corruption? Genocide? Totalitarianism? Naaaa duuuude, those things will *never* happen here. That's why I voted for more government power - because I'm so generous and I care about the oppressed. Big daddy gov will protect us all' - said the sheep who sold freedom for comfort, moments before being sent to a gulag.

    <td><b>5. (optional) SICP</b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup>click to expand</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Master the ideas in 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs'. Learn how to be a 'great hacker'. You don't have to be the best software architect; just remember the value you can add to a team or project if you know how to architect and design clean, elegant systems.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Learn what crappy and mediocre hackers do. Look at all the ways they fail to hide complexity, and screw up technical decisions to exponentially slow productivity. Read 'spaghetti code'. Read 'lasagne code'. Read crappy documentation. Read code written by sh**ty developers with no clarity of thought, or inexperienced developers who were rushed. In fact, read your own code and criticise it (harshly). Again, you don't have to write the greatest software - just don't make stupid, irreversible decisions that exponentially slow you down.
