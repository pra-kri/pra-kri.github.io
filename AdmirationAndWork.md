### An Admiration-Based Approach to Work (redone: 10/07/20)

# DISCLAIMER: This is advice to myself, obviously. It might not apply to everyone else...

**Ideally, knowledge should be powerful**; Your knowledge should help you become a better decision maker under risk and uncertainty; it should help you gain control over your own time so you can sacrifice that time for what you deeply care about. If you're not choosing your own sacrifices, how is it any different to slavery? Your knowledge should develop your character and make your conversations and relationships more colourful; it should make your life more meaningful; it should help you carve out your own place in society and give you more opportunities to be a bit more like the men you admire. Your knowledge, and your work, should have a sense of humanity and admiration behind it. 

**And what if it's not like that?**  Then maybe you're working on stupid sh\*t. If it doesn't help you become more interesting and admirable, if your conversations and relationships are *less* colourful because of your work, if it detracts from your life, and it doesn't help you pick up responsibility and take your place in your community... then what are you? A drone-like insect? Sounds great, have fun. Keep doing that. Maybe one day you'll get the pleasant opportunity to learn what 'regret' and 'wasted life' means. (*For a similar but much more polite and classy argument, please see 'On The Shortness of Life' by Seneca. He's much more well-spoken and well-informed than I am...*)

    <td> <details><summary><sup>Useful in small teams + entrepreneurial ventures; Allows risk-taking (<i>~courage</i>) ...<i>(Read more)</i></sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b><u>Does the skill help you relentlessly and aggressively hunt down opportunities, without need for permission?</u> Is it independent and self-reliant? Can you create value and wealth in entrepreneurial ventures with small teams? ('front-office', close-to-the-money, revenue-generating?). Will it help you take risks and chase opportunities in the open market? Does it help you gain ownership of your own time and wealth? Is it independent enough that it lets you do 'spec-work', so you can pursue clients and customers in your own time? In other words, does the knowledge help you become more <i><b>self-owned and courageous</b></i> in the world? <small>(Also: if your entire team is full of skilled, self-reliant guys with countless other opportunities to chase, and yet they all willingly work together for a long time, then it's because of mutual respect and loyalty - not because they desperately grabbed the closest team that had low enough standards to let them in. Same principle applies to relationships too: you want to be chosen by someone self-reliant with many options. Not someone who desperately grabbed the nearest thing with a pulse and a wallet ;) ).</small>
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or is it a heavily dependent skill that's useless outside of large corporations? Will it make you fragile and dependent on corporate 'performance' reviews and the whims of the geniuses working in HR departments? Is it a skill that only pays if you offer your obedience, 'hard work' and conformity to a bigcorp? Will you end up like those idiots who are strangely proud of how many <i>hours</i> they obediently 'worked hard' for someone who doesn't care about them? That's not 'loyalty' or 'work ethic'... that's just cheap obedience and fear of alternative consequences. (And loyalty, just like respect, is only worth something when given to you by an untamed wolf - not when it comes from a domesticated, housebroken lapdog. That's true both metaphorically and literally.). A very similar argument can be made about those who choose comfortable and 'politically correct' opinions out of obedience and fear. <b>Their opinions, just like their salary, are heavily dependent on approval.</b>
      <br> <i>Disclaimer: Obviously there are cases where people have no other choice but work in crappy jobs because of family circumstances and responsibilities. We're not talking about those guys. They're actually admirable - sacrificing their time and energy for their family. No, the targets of disdain here are the guys with very little responsibility, yet choose comfort and safety out of passivity and cheap obedience. </i>

    <td><b>2. Wisdom, Respect</b><br><sup>(Wisdom, Epistemic Humility: managing risks under uncertainty)</sup></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>Can compound knowledge/experience for decision-making over time (<i>~wisdom</i>) ...<i>(Read more)</i></sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b><u>Does the skill help you earn respect and accumulate wisdom?</u> Does it help you make better decisions under uncertainty? Will it help you mitigate and appropriately handle risk? A few indicators that might help: Does it have timeless principles that will stay true for decades? A lot of timeless knowledge is linked to uncertainty, risk and decision-making, where it usually ends up being called 'wisdom'. <b>In your 40s and 50s, if you learn the right stuff, will your knowledge and voice be respected and taken seriously? </b> Archetypally speaking, will the knowledge help you age into the respectable 'grizzled veteran'? Knowledge should make you better at handling the unknown, and it should earn you respect: <i><b>wisdom, decision-making, epistemic humility</b></i>.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or are you learning something that'll be useless in 10 years time? Is it just a dumb fad that you'll eventually forget? Are you learning something that requires no respect for the unknown? Something that demands no epistemic humility and thought? When you're older, will a bunch of arrogant 23-year-olds (just like you right now) know as much as 50-year-old-you about the subject? <b>Will you end up like some of those older guys with no wisdom to impart, and garner no respect from their colleagues, because they wasted too much time learning dumb sh*t? </b> If people aren't looking to you for guidance and wisdom when you're older, and your opinion isn't respected, then maybe you f***ed up. If you are 'respected' solely because of job title and how long you've been at a company, then that's not true respect - that's just decorative politeness. Also, notice the interesting link between courage and wisdom: if you never have the courage to venture into uncertain territory and make your own mistakes, you'll never pick up much personal wisdom and experience. From a nerdy mathematical perspective, maybe: d(Wisdom)/dt = Courage. Personal experience seems to agree: you learnt the most from the actions that you were originally scared to take, and the difficult conversations you were scared to have.

    <td><b>3. Clarity of Thought, Craft-Like</b><br><sup>('BS-Detection': signal vs noise; filtering under uncertainty)</sup></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>Rewards creativity, independent thought and contrarianism (<i>~clarity of thought</i>) ...<i>(Read more)</i></sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b><u>Is the skill craft-like? Does it reward clarity of thought, logic and creativity all at once? To master it, do you need a healthy mix of both science (logic) and art (creativity)? </u> Slightly related to wisdom, but this principle focuses more on creativity and contrarian unruliness, rather than conservative risk-management. Does it train you to sift through useless noise to get to the important, central principles - the 'signal'. <i>And maybe more importantly, if you apply this 'signal-noise filtering' idea to rules and restrictions, you'll get to the idea of unruliness and a healthy sense of disobedience: the art of knowing which rules to ignore, break and laugh at.</i> This trains you to cut through worthless information in books and words too ('BS-detection': what is this person (or text) <i>actually</i> trying to say? How much of it is useless fluff that I can ignore?).  How else can you outclass the 'hard-working' idiots who take pride in the sheer number of hours they throw at their problems? <u>Instead of hours spent, you should take pride in clarity, craftsmanship and mastery.</u> Also, craft-like skills tend to allow you to build a reputation: you can directly claim ownership over the quality work that you do (which leads to: more £££, more opportunities, more choice, more leverage). 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or is the work output mostly the same, regardless of how much thought goes into it? Three interesting questions. <b>1.</b><i>The 'Hangover Question': </i>Can you output high quality work with a splitting hangover? <b>2.</b><i>The Young Millionaire Question:</i> Are there some extremely successful guys in their 20s and 30s in the field, who reached the top through creative/contrarian thinking without having to follow the traditional path over decades? <b>3.</b><i>The 'Reputation Question':</i> Are there 'famous' practitioners who've built a reputation for themselves through the quality of their work and claim a large share of the rewards? There are reputable investors, startup founders, hackers, writers, researchers, professors, surgeons, attorneys...etc, but why do you never hear about famous back-office support employees? The more the quality of your work directly affects the final outcome, the more you can build a reputation for skill and claim a larger reward. This front-office/back-office split is very obvious in finance, but you  might come across similar divisions in medicine (surgeons vs nurses), law (attorneys vs paralegals), consulting (revenue-generating partners vs normal consultants), writing (authors vs editors), movies (directors and actors vs production crew) and even e-sports (carry vs support).

Below are a few craft-like skills that reward both logical thinking (*science*) and creativity (*art*), and are also self-reliant in the open market (*entrepreneurship, close-to-the-money*). And finally, they're fields where you can *pick up wisdom and gain respect over time*, since they require management of risk and epistemic humility. In other words: they're skills that help you explore uncertain territory.

    <td><b>1. Writing</b></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup> Clarity and depth of thought, through writing. ...(Read more)</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> <u>Exploration of uncertainty through words and essays:</u> Become a skilled writer with clarity, depth and idiosyncrasy. Cut through the useless noise; get to the central ideas. Write essays and research papers. Explore interesting, important and controversial topics. Develop interesting, well-formed opinions and convictions. To be honest, you should care less about writing itself, but more about clarity of thought. Erudition and ownership of your own opinions: that's the target. Writing is just a way to practice this.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b> Don't be one of those idiots who have nothing valuable to say: the types who can't think well, and fill their words with empty fluff. Maybe they have underdeveloped opinions and obediently think what they're told to think. No individuality or depth in their perspective whatsoever; just blind conformity. A few colourful terms come to mind: 'useful idiots', 'NPC', 'sheeple'.

    <td><details><summary><sup> Probability Theory, Information Theory, Machine Learning. ...(Read more)</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: <u>Exploration of uncertainty through quantitative modelling:</u> </b> Build a deep, <b>intuitive</b> understanding of randomness, uncertainty, information and prediction - from a quantitative and computational perspective. <u>You want a 'latticework' of interconnected knowledge that combines <b>Probability Theory, Information Theory, Machine Learning & Complexity</b></u>. Focus less on theoretical discoveries, and more on proper application in R&D, entrepreneurship and investing: problems that are 'close to the money'. <br>
      (Practice > Theory). (Intuition > Formality). (Well-developed latticework of knowledge > Disconnected series of facts).  
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Study all the ways that people get tricked and lied to, by deceptive statistics and machine learning models. Find out how both idiots and liars can manipulate decisions through misleading quantitative models and stupid assumptions. (apparently this is a good book that talks a lot about assumptions and mistakes: <i>'Statistical Models: Theory and Practice</i> - D. Freedman)

    <td><details><summary><sup> 'Great Hackers', Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ...(Read more)</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> <u>Exploration of uncertain startup and software opportunities:</u> If you ever want to chase market opportunities quickly and effectively in small teams in a technical capacity, you really need to be a 'Great Hacker', or at least not a bad one. <u>Fundamentally, you need to be able to self-reliantly <b>build</b> software to chase market opportunities and solve problems. That's all.</u> Read and master 'The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs' and learn the general principles of building good architecture. At the very least, you should be able to write well-structured, clean code. Think about it this way: there are thousands of 'software engineers' out there. How many of them can put together a clean, well-designed system together quickly and reliably? And of those guys, how many of them have the contrarianism and business sense to jump on entrepreneurial opportunities and build something from scratch? That's your goal. You're not aiming to be a normal 'software developer'. There're countless guys like that who end up wasting their days away on tedious CRUD apps in the backwaters of some massive corporation, far away from the revenue. You're aiming to <u>build products from scratch</u> in a revenue-generating capacity. These 3 books should help you do that properly, through learning Lisp: SICP, ANSI Common Lisp, On Lisp. (The last 2 books were written by Paul Graham. Who better to learn from? Maybe after that you can start to look at Ruby-on-Rails and the stuff written by the guys from 37Signals/Basecamp.) (Also: good article: Six Principles for Making New Things - by Paul Graham)
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Spaghetti code. Lasagne code. Exponential productivity decreases. Making stupid, almost irreversible, technical decisions that prevents you from building the next thing. A codebase that starts to look more like a liability than an asset. See: <i>'The Total Cost of Owning a Mess' (from Clean Code, by R. Martin)</i>.<br> And in terms of work: software jobs that are deep inside the back- and middle-office in large corporations. Software roles that are far away from the money, working on crappy legacy codebases.

    <td><b>4. Risk vs. Return <sub>(Investing, VC, Capital)</sub></b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup> Mitigate risk first, then aggressively hunt returns. ...(Read more)</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> <u>Managing risk and maximising return in different fields under uncertainty:</u> There are a few fields full of interesting writers who stress the imporance of wisdom (<i>risk-management, epistemic humility</i>), courage (<i>risk-taking, skin-in-the-game</i>) and independent thinking (<i>filtering signal from noise</i>). The central principle is something like: <u>How can you minimise risk while maximising returns</u>? A few fields that come to mind are:<u> 1.Investing, 2.Startups + Silicon Valley, 3.Intelligence + Military Strategy, 4.Medicine, 5.Policy, Risk, Governance.</u> They're all fields where navigating risk and uncertainty are crucial - not just a casual afterthought. 
      <br>
      For now, focus on building a deep understanding of the first field: <b>investing, VC and capital allocation</b>. Where should you allocate capital (and time) in the market? What signals can you use to predict growth and value in companies? Learn from investors in different fields. Value (Buffett, Munger, Klarman...), VC (Paul Graham, Peter Thiel - Zero to One, Tim Ferriss' interviews with a LOT of angel investors), Quants (Taleb, Spitznagel, Thorp, AQR, Winton, ...), Global Macro (Dalio, Soros)...etc. 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Learn how all the bad investors lose money. How should you *NOT* manage your risk? Find all the ways that mediocre portfolio managers manage their investments. And for startups, learn how to tell when a startup looks crap: what signals should you watch out for? This might also be useful when deciding on which startup to join. For medicine, learn about <i>iatrogenesis</i>. And learn about risk in policy, governance, failed interventions and centralised power (see: Totalitarianism, Fascism, unintended consequences, the oh-so-great-and-clearly-democratic EU, and well-informed thoughtful opinions that sound eerily similar to '<i>but that wasnt real communism maaaaan</i>'). To summarise: learn all about stupidity, ignorance and bias in many different fields. <b>If you're really as smart as you pretend to be, maybe you could find a way to profit off of these idiots?</b> (an observation: comedic value is also a type of profit. Dave Chappelle probably agrees.)

To summarise: Aim for **close-to-the-money R&D** work with a real chance of failure (**risk**).
* **close-to-the-money**: your actions should directly affect the primary target of the project. Usually, in business, that's revenue. But in some industries and domains it might be a different measure (e.g. medical projects might measure success in terms of lives saved). But whatever project you work on, make sure you work on things that *directly impact the final results in a measurable way*. 
* **R&D**: creative, practical, brand-new work that hasn't been done before. Requires both logic and creativity and practical thinking. 
* **Risk**: there should be a real chance of failure. If *anyone* could easily do it with minimal chance of failure, then its probably better to focus on something else instead. If everyone could do it easily, is it really a good opportunity? And if everyone could do it, then you are now just a replaceable commodity with no power or control over your working environment, pay and schedule. (see: low-skill employees and the stuff that they have to deal with)
