### An Admiration-Based Approach to Work

**Ideally, knowledge should be powerful**; it should help you become a better decision maker under risk and uncertainty; it should help you gain control over your own time so you can sacrifice that time for what you deeply care about (i.e. the freedom to choose your sacrifices and constraints, the freedom to take risks); it should develop your character and make your conversations and relationships more colourful; it should make your life more meaningful; it should help you carve out your own place in society and give you more opportunities to be a bit more like the men you admire. Your knowledge, and your work, should have a sense of humanity and admiration behind it.

**And what if it's not like that?**  Then maybe you're working on stupid sh\*t. If it doesn't help you become more interesting and admirable, and if your conversations and relationships are *less* colourful because of your work, and it doesn't help you pick up responsibility and take your place in your community... then what the f\*\*k? What are you? A drone-like insect? Sounds great, have fun. Maybe one day you'll get the pleasant opportunity to learn what 'regret' and 'wasted life' means. (*For a similar but more polite and classy argument see 'On The Shortness of Life' by Seneca*)

    <td> <details><summary><sup>Useful in small teams + entrepreneurial ventures; Allows risk-taking (<i>~courage</i>) ...<i>(Read more)</i></sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b><u>Does the skill help you relentlessly and aggressively hunt down opportunities, without need for permission?</u> Is it independent and self-reliant? Can you create value and wealth in entrepreneurial ventures with small teams? ('front-office', close-to-the-money, revenue-generating?). Will it help you take risks and chase opportunities in the open market? Does it help you gain ownership of your own time and wealth? Is it independent enough that it lets you do 'spec-work', so you can pursue clients and customers in your own time? In other words, does the knowledge help you become more <i><b>self-owned and courageous</b></i> in the world? 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or is it a heavily dependent, specialised skill that's useless outside of large corporations? Will it make you fragile and dependent on corporate 'performance' reviews, your manager's opinion, and the whims of the geniuses working in HR departments? Is it a skill that only pays if you offer your obedience, 'hard work' and conformity to a bigcorp? Will you end up like those idiots who are strangely proud of how many <i>hours</i> they obediently 'worked hard' for someone else who doesn't care about them? That's not 'loyalty' or 'work ethic'... that's just cheap obedience and fear of alternative consequences. <br> <i>Disclaimer: Obviously there are cases where people have no other choice but work in crappy jobs because of family circumstances and responsibilities. We're not talking about those guys. They're actually admirable - sacrificing their time and energy for their family. No, the target of contempt here is actually the free man who willingly domesticated himself when he had many other options and very few responsibilities.  That's probably harsh, yes - but the problem is if you don't feel strong contempt at this sort of choice, it's so easy to fall into that comfortable lifestyle by default, and then regret it years down the line.</i>

    <td><b>2. Wisdom, Respect</b><br><sup>(Wisdom, Epistemic Humility: managing risks under uncertainty)</sup></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>Can compound knowledge/experience for decision-making over time (<i>~wisdom</i>) ...<i>(Read more)</i></sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b><u>Does the skill help you earn respect and accumulate wisdom?</u> Does it help you make better decisions under uncertainty? Will it help you mitigate and appropriately handle risk? A few indicators that might help: Does it have timeless principles that will stay true for decades? A lot of timeless knowledge is linked to uncertainty, risk and decision-making, where it usually ends up being called 'wisdom'. <b>In your 40s and 50s, if you learn the right stuff, will your knowledge and voice be respected and taken seriously? </b> Archetypally speaking, will the knowledge help you age into the respectable 'grizzled veteran'? Knowledge should make you better at handling the unknown, and it should earn you respect: <i><b>wisdom, decision-making, epistemic humility</b></i>.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or are you learning something that'll be useless in 10 years time? Is it just a dumb fad that you'll eventually forget? Are you learning something that requires no respect for the unknown? Something that demands no epistemic humility and thought? When you're older, will a bunch of arrogant 23-year-olds (just like you right now) know as much as 50-year-old-you about the subject? <b>Will you end up like some of those older guys with no wisdom to impart, and garner no respect from their colleagues, because they wasted too much time learning dumb sh*t? </b> If people aren't looking to you for guidance and wisdom when you're older, and your opinion isn't respected, then maybe you f***ed up. Also, notice the interesting link between courage and wisdom: if you never have the courage to venture into uncertain territory and make your own mistakes, you'll never pick up much personal wisdom and experience. From a nerdy mathematical perspective, Wisdom may be seen as something like the first integral of Courage over time. Personal experience seems to agree: you learnt the most from the actions that you were originally scared to take, and the difficult conversations you were scared to have.

    <td><b>3. Clarity of Thought, Craft-Like</b><br><sup>('BS-Detection': signal vs noise; filtering under uncertainty)</sup></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup>Rewards creativity, independent thought and contrarianism (<i>~clarity of thought</i>) ...<i>(Read more)</i></sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b><u>Is the skill craft-like? Does it reward clarity of thought, logic and creativity all at once? Does it contain a healthy mix of science and art? </u> Related to wisdom, but this focuses more on creativity and contrarian unruliness, rather than conservative risk-management. Does it train you to sift through useless noise to get to the important, central principles - the 'signal'. <i>And most importantly, if you apply this 'signal-noise filtering' idea to rules and restrictions, you'll get to the idea of unruliness and a healthy sense of disobedience: the willingness to treat rules and conventions like inconvenient noise to be filtered. Know which rules you can break (ethically).</i> Trains you to cut through worthless information in books and words too - a skill informally called 'BS-detection'.  How else can you outclass the 'hard-working' idiots who take pride in the sheer numbers of hours they throw at their problems? Also, craft-like skills tend to allow you to build a reputation: you can directly claim ownership over the quality work that you do. (which leads to: more £££, more opportunities, more choice, more leverage) 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Or is the work output mostly the same, regardless of how much thought goes into it? Three interesting questions. <b>1.</b><i>The 'Hangover Question': </i>Can you output high quality work with a splitting hangover? <b>2.</b><i>The Young Millionaire Question:</i> Are there some extremely successful guys in their 20s and 30s in the field, who reached the top through creative/contrarian thinking without having to follow the traditional path over decades? <b>3.</b><i>The 'Fame Question':</i> Are there 'famous' practitioners who've built a reputation for themselves through the quality of their work and claim a large share of the rewards? There are reputable investors, startup founders, hackers, writers, researchers, professors, surgeons, attorneys...etc, but why do you never hear about famous back-office support employees? The front-office/back-office split is very obvious in finance, but you  might come across similar ideas in software (core developers vs 'software testers'), hospitals (surgeons vs nurses), law (attorneys vs paralegals), and even e-sports (carry vs support).

Below are a few craft-like skills that reward both logical thinking (*science*) and creativity (*art*). More importantly though, they're skills that are self-reliant and useful in the open market (*entrepreneurship, close-to-the-money*), and they're fields where you can *pick up wisdom and gain respect over time*.

    <td><b>1. Writing</b></td>
    <td> <details><summary><sup> Clarity and depth of thought, through writing. ...(Read more)</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Become a skilled writer with clarity, depth and idiosyncrasy. Cut through the useless noise; get to the central ideas. Write essays and research papers. Explore interesting, important and controversial topics. Develop interesting, well-formed opinions and convictions. To be honest, you should care less about writing itself, but more about clarity of thought. Erudition and ownership of your own opinions: that's the target. Writing is just a way to practice this.
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b> Don't be one of those idiots who have nothing valuable to say: the types who can't think well, and fill their words with empty fluff. Maybe they have underdeveloped opinions and obediently think what they're told to think. No individuality or depth in their perspective whatsoever; just blind conformity. A few colourful terms come to mind: 'useful idiots', 'NPC', 'sheeple'.

    <td><b>2. Computational + Statistical Modelling </b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup> Probability Theory, Information Theory, Machine Learning. ...(Read more)</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> Build a deep, <b>intuitive</b> understanding of randomness, uncertainty, information and prediction - from a quantitative and computational perspective. <u>You want a 'latticework' of interconnected knowledge that combines <b>Probability Theory, Information Theory, Machine Learning & Complexity</b></u>. Focus less on theoretical discoveries, and more on proper application in R&D, entrepreneurship and investing: problems that are 'close to the money'. <br>
      (Practice > Theory). (Intuition > Formality). (Well-developed latticework of knowledge > Disconnected series of facts).  
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Study all the ways that people get tricked and lied to, by deceptive statistics and machine learning models. Find out how both idiots and liars can manipulate decisions through misleading quantitative models and stupid assumptions. (apparently this is a good book that talks a lot about assumptions and mistakes: <i>'Statistical Models: Theory and Practice</i> - D. Freedman)

    <td><details><summary><sup> 'Great Hackers', Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ...(Read more)</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> If you ever want to chase market opportunities quickly and effectively in small teams in a technical capacity, you really need to be a 'Great Hacker', or at least not a bad one. Read and master 'The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs' and learn the general principles of building good architecture. At the very least, you should be able to write well-structured, clean code. 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Spaghetti code. Lasagne code. Exponential productivity decreases. Making reallllly stupid, almost irreversible, technical decisions that prevents you from building the next thing. A codebase that starts to look more like a liability than an asset. See: <i>'The Total Cost of Owning a Mess'</i>(Ch.1 of Clean Code, by R.Martin), and maybe 'The Mythical Man-Month'.

    <td><b>4. Risk vs. Return <sub>(Investing, VC, Capital)</sub></b></td>
    <td><details><summary><sup> Mitigate risk first, then aggressively hunt returns. ...(Read more)</sup></summary>
      <b> Ideal: </b> There are a few fields full of interesting writers who stress the imporance of wisdom (<i>risk-management, epistemic humility</i>), courage (<i>risk-taking, skin-in-the-game</i>) and independent thinking (<i>filtering signal from noise</i>). The central principle is something like: <b>How can you minimise risk while maximising returns</b>? A few fields that come to mind are:<u> 1.Investing, 2.Startups + Silicon Valley, 3.Intelligence + Military Strategy, 4.Medicine, 5.Policy, Risk, Governance.</u> They're all fields where navigating risk and uncertainty are crucial - not just a casual afterthought. 
      <br>
      For now, focus on building a deep understanding of <b>investing, VC and capital allocation</b>. Where should you allocate capital (and time) in the market? What signals can you use to predict growth and value in companies? Learn from investors in different fields. Value (Buffett, Munger, Klarman...), VC (Paul Graham, Peter Thiel - Zero to One, Tim Ferriss' interviews with a LOT of angel investors), Quants (Taleb, Spitznagel, Thorp, AQR, Winton, ...), Global Macro (Dalio, Soros)...etc. 
      <br>
      <b> Anti-Ideal: </b>Learn how all the bad investors lose money. How should you *NOT* manage your risk? Find all the ways that mediocre portfolio managers manage their investments. And for startups, learn how to tell when a startup looks crap: what signals should you watch out for? This might also be useful when deciding on which startup to join. For medicine, learn about <i>iatrogenesis</i>. And learn about risk in policy, governance, failed interventions and centralised power (see: Totalitarianism, Fascism, unintended consequences, the oh-so-great-and-clearly-democratic EU, and well-informed thoughtful opinions that sound eerily similar to '<i>but that wasnt real communism maaaaan</i>'). To summarise: learn all about stupidity, ignorance and bias in many different fields. <b>If you're really as smart as you pretend to be, maybe you could find a way to profit off of these idiots?</b> If there's no punishment for harm-causing idiocy, how would people ever learn? You're not virtuous or patient enough to calmly explain why certain are ideas are wrong, so why not enjoy making a profit out of them? (Random observation: comedic value is also a kind of profit. Dave Chappelle probably agrees.)
