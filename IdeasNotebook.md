<p class="message">
  <b>A notebook of quick ideas, thoughts, mental models and reminders.</b> <br>
  Any time you read something interesting or useful that you might want to explore in the future, take note of it here. Otherwise, you'll end up forgetting it. Compound and structure your ideas here. 
  
  <b>Possible topics:</b> ethics/behaviour, neuroscience, risk, probability + statistics + ML, investing, startups + VC, thoughts on careers + work...etc
  
  For each idea: just a small paragraph, explaining <b>1.</b>the central principles, <b>2.</b>what to avoid (misapplications, risk), <b>3.</b>possible questions and connections to consider.
  
  Even if you only write down 1 interesting technique/idea/thought a week, by the end of the year you should have at least 50 decent paragraphs to think about. 
</p>


##### --. (todo) The volatility tax: log-returns, losing 50% means you need to gain 100%.

##### --. (todo) Trading and investing ideas: look at mathematical derivatives and integrals, maybe. Instead of absolute values (y), what happens if you look at dy/dt? Or what about dy/dx? Or integrate y w.r.t. t or x, but with limited windows? ...etc

##### --. (todo) Inhibitory wisdom: Risk management and what NOT to do.

##### --. (todo) Inhibitory neurons: the 'corpus callosum' and modulation of neural signals. 

##### --. (todo) Investing in monopolistic businesses - Lesson from both Peter Thiel and Warren Buffet

##### --. (todo) Taleb's Barbell Strategy

##### --. (todo) What to learn: Knowledge vs Trivia

##### --. (todo) Uncertainty in limited doses: curiosity, serendipity, adventure...

##### --. (todo) Motivation and unearned dopamine in the morning; why you shouldn't listen to music until the evening.

##### --. (todo) Productivity Trick: Listen to the same song on repeat. What's the possible neuroscience behind that??

##### --. (todo) A set of highly related traits to work on: 'High Agency' (Eric Weinstein), 'Relentlessly Resourceful' (Paul Graham), 'Extreme Ownership' and 'Default:aggressive' (Jocko Willink), 'Aggressive Tinkering' (Nassim Taleb)

##### --. (todo) Procrastination as wisdom: Is your psyche trying to tell you something? 

##### --. (todo) Filtration mechanisms through opinions: The risks and rewards for being a polarising s.o.b. 

##### --. (todo) Measuring fragility of career choice: How many clients do you have? Sources of demand? Intensity of demand?

##### --. (todo) The Kelly Criterion: Bet sizes for gambling and investing.

##### --. (todo) Lying with Correlation: how can I lie with the simple, well-known measure of correlation?

##### --. (todo) Ethics and virtue as self-imposed constraints: If its not self-imposed out of a sense of self-respect, then is it cheap obedience out of fear?

##### 11. (todo) Wisdom as the sum of Courage over time
Sum up (or *integrate*) the number of courageous actions you took last year. That's probably proportional to the amount of wisdom and experience you gained. If it wasn't scary, then you probably didn't learn sh\*\*. 

##### 10. (todo) Evolutionary attractiveness of the 'shadow': Why do people like Anti-Heroes and Femme Fatales?

##### 9. (todo) The Unexpected Important of Speech: words affect life-paths much more than you thought...

##### 8. (todo) A genuine question about p-values and disconfirmation of knowledge...

##### 7. (todo) The Need to be Activated: Brain regions and a framework for viewing emotions that come from 'lack of something' (e.g. boredom from lack of stimulation, loneliness from lack of connection, agitation from lack of action).
Just like your circadian rhythm cycles through states once a day or so, are there similar cyclical activation requirements in many parts of your brain? Are there parts of your brain that need to be activated once every few hours, or days? Is that the neural basis for emotions like boredom and loneliness - not enough activation of certain regions? Is there an activation requirement for the neural regions associated with aggression and competition? Do we all occasionally need something to fight against - an opportunity to commit acts of heroism or sacrifice? Or are we perfectly fine with comfort, cushy office jobs and mindless consumerism in the evenings? I wonder if this is linked to the accelerating depression rates and mental health issues. If Rafiki (and Mufasa's ghost) didn't remind Simba to heroically take his place in the kingdom, would he have spent the rest of his days feeling existentially anxious, playing video games, uploading instagram photos, and watching videos on netflix (or other *less conventional* websites)? 

##### 8. (todo) Viewing psychology through the lens of 'sub-personalities', and being 'possessed' by ancient neural forces that are much older and deeper than you. 
'You don't get angry. *Anger gets you*.' - JBP (Also: you don't get interested. Interesting things *capture* you. It's not your *choice* - you barely have any control over your curiosity. If you had full control of your interest, then procrastination wouldn't exist... You'd just control your emotions to become excited...)

##### 6. (todo) Brain Hemispheres: Structural differences and consequences (esp. for processing novelty + uncertainty)

##### 5. (todo) Dopamine, Play and Hunting: Why do we respect wolves more than rabbits?
(The evolutionary basis of admiration and respect in social hunting animals. e.g. Wolves, Chimpanzees.)

##### 4. (todo) Interconnectivity and Systemic Risk: Pandemics, War and Economic Shocks

##### 3. (todo) The Idiocy of 'Hard Work': Why people who claim to 'work hard' are admitting slavery

##### 2. (todo) The Occasional Virtue of Arrogance: how else can you aim to be creative and contrarian?

##### 1. (todo) The Cheap 'Virtue' of Obedience: roots of totalitarianism and fascism.
