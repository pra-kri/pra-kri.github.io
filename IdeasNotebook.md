<p class="message">
  <b>A notebook of quick ideas, thoughts, mental models and reminders.</b> <br>
  Any time you read something interesting or useful that you might want to explore in the future, take note of it here. Otherwise, you'll end up forgetting it. Compound and structure your ideas here. Possible topics: probability + statistics + ML, investing, startups + VC, neuroscience, risk, thoughts on careers + work...etc
  
  For each idea: just a small paragraph, explaining <b>1.</b>the central principles, <b>2.</b>what to avoid (misapplications, risk), <b>3.</b>possible questions and connections to consider.
  
  Even if you only write down 1 interesting technique/idea/thought a week, by the end of the year you should have at least 50 decent paragraphs to think about.
