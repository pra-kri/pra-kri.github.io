<p class="message">
  <b>A notebook of quick ideas, thoughts, mental models and reminders.</b> <br>
  Any time you read something interesting or useful that you might want to explore in the future, take note of it here. Otherwise, you'll end up forgetting it. Compound and structure your ideas here. 
  <br>
  <b>Possible topics:</b> ethics/behaviour, neuroscience, risk, probability + statistics + ML, investing, startups + VC, thoughts on careers + work...etc
  <br>
  Even if you only write down 1 interesting technique/idea/thought a week, by the end of the year you should have at least 50 decent paragraphs to think about. 
</p>



##### Rate maximisation of X/Y (Should you maximise the numerator, or minimise the denominator?)
You want to maximise the rate of X per Y. Trying to increase the rate of X is numerically, but not practically, equivalent to decreasing Y. Real life example 1: Returns/Risk in finance. Maximising returns and finding alpha might be a very different activity to finding sources of risk and minimising them. But both actions lead to a higer ratio of returns to risk. Sounds very obvious, but maybe it gets forgotten in practice.<br>
'The essence of investment management is the management of risks, not the management of returns.' - Benjamin Graham

##### Gatekeepers and Rejection
I've noticed that rejection feels fair when it seems like I've been judged on my actual qualities. Sure, it hurts a little bit - but there's no 'salty' resentment at the rejection: I feel perfectly fine, and if anything it motivates me to improve my skills. 

But when a rejection feels like it was based on surface level inaccurate information, and the rejection was made by someone who couldn't make a proper judgement, there's leftover resentment - it feels *almost* unfair. Most commonly, 'unfair' rejections seem to come from gatekeepers: or those who don't have the skills to judge quality, but are in the position to do so. In other words, skillless recruiters and HR leeches with disproportionate power and influence. The types who are impressed by buzzwords, while the only tangible skill they themselves have is 'sending emails'. 

It might be a good idea to avoid these leech-like gatekeeper types, for the sake of staying motivated - even if you lose out on possible opportunities.


##### Belief for 
 

##### Intervention vs Post-hoc Analysis
Within fields like Medicine, how much extra data can you collect and 'exploit' through measuring the effectiveness of small actions and interventions, rather than doing one large snapshot statistical analysis after all the treatment is done? How much data granularity do you lose by viewing a complex sequence of events as a single outcome *after* the ordeal? What examples can you find irl?

##### Information Theory for Risk Management and Gambling - but not in finance or games...
Can you use information theory in non-finance fields to decide which action to 'bet' on? Can you develop quick heuristics to help make decisions? If outcomes are linked and complex, can you model that as a network/graph? Then, can you apply information theory to the graph/network?

##### Kelly Criterion though Neural Networks?
Can you train a neural network to make appropriate bet sizes? Will it converge to something well-known? (like the Kelly Criterion?). 

##### Neural Networks to read other NNs??
Can you get a neural network to read another neural network? In other words: the input to NN.1 is the whole of NN.2. Maybe NN1 can learn what NN2 is 'thinking' and how it might respond to new data? Sounds computationally complex, but what problems might this solve? Will it be worth the time and effort? Is that what GNNs do? 

##### 'Universe selection' in statistical modelling
Obvious reminder: if a model doesnt have any predictive power for 100 stocks of various types, maybe the model would start to get more useful if you split the 100 into groups by industry or sector or some other criteria. 

##### --. Entropy in the brain, immune system, ..etc
Is the novelty or unexpectedness of a piece of information related to the amount of entropy it introduces into the neural connections in your brain? If a new piece of information 'affects' you and makes you re-think something that you initially believed to be true, did it introduce a large amount of entropy in your nerve connections? The feeling you get when things just 'click' and make sense - is that related to minimising entropy, or at least reaching some local minima? Maybe dopamine acts as a network strengthening agent, to reduce entropy, in a way...? What about the immune system? Are there any interesting ways entropy and your immune system are linked? Is the novelty of pathogen protein structure somehow related to how seriously your immune system takes it initially? What other biological systems (might) 'respond' to entropy? 

##### --. Temporary Correlations
Consider this situation: the correlation between variables A and B are not always be constant, and fluctuate over time. But if you knew they *did* correlate heavily under certain circumstances, can you *force* them to become temporarily correlated through manipulating the circumstances? What can you do to *temporarily 'crystallise' the correlation between A and B*? And more interestingly, how can you profit from it, before the correlation dissolves away? Is the risk/return ratio worth it? (interesting quote about RenTec that I read on some random answer on Quora: "Someone has to create the correlations in the markets." Don't know how legit it is though.) More importantly though... is correlation even the right tool?...(pls study).

##### --. Monopolistic Poaching of Brains?
If you were a company that was dominating the market in a certain technical field through propietary knowledge(e.g. Deep learning, quantitative trading, search engines...etc) but you didn't want to apply for a patent, and a *very* smart PhD seems to be publishing papers that are scarily close to your trade secrets, would it be profitable to hire them with an outrageous offer? Say, Â£300k+ starting? The cost of leaving them alone to publish research close to your 'edge' might be much more than the 300k you pay the researcher. Plus, you now have another researcher working with you, AND they probably signed a non-compete to join you anyways, AND they can still be profitable. And they can no longer join one of your main competitors. If Ed Thorp hired Black, Scholes and Merton before they published their formulae, would he have been able to keep that knowledge propietary for much longer? 

##### --. Information Theory and Quants
Jim Simons, Elwyn Berlekamp, Ed Thorp, Leonard Baum (Baum-Welch algorithm...) and a few other guys - a lot of quants have an Information-Theory background, or at least were closely linked to the subject. Simons was a code-breaker during the Cold War. Ed Thorp worked with ***Claude Shannon*** (!!!) and J.L.Kelly  (Kelly criterion...)for various gambling techniques and tools. Lots of connections to information theory, computational linguistics, code breaking...etc. But when I look at online quant resources, there's hardly any mention of information theory. Instead, a bunch of guys write shitty tutorials on 'Markowitz Portfolio Optimisation' and 'Value at Risk'... strange... Either Information Theory is useless so it doesn't get mentioned often, or it's very useful, so people actively avoid mentioning it. Or more realistically, the quants who are actually making money don't need to write crappy posts and websites like this one (and worse: blogs mentioning anything like 'Efficient Market Hypothesis'). Plus, they're probably not allowed to disclose much information... Also, quite recently, N.N.Taleb has spoken about entropy, mutual information and 'Elements of Information Theory' a few times on Twitter.  So studying Information Theory might be a good bet this year...

##### --. (todo) The volatility tax: log-returns, losing 50% means you need to gain 100%.

##### --. (todo) Sleep position and cerebrospinal fluid movement
Learnt something interesting: apparently your sleep position affects how well your cerebrospinal fluid cleans out your brain. Sleeping on your side is most efficient apparently. (brain needs to be cleaned of all its metabolic waste at night). (also: apparently Dolphins can tell one hemisphere to go to sleep, while the other stays awake... Do both sides of the brain get cleared of toxins at the same time? Or only the sleeping side?)

##### --. (todo) Checklists as outsourced intelligence. (a bit like this page... meta..)
Use checklists compiled over months or even years to remind you of the small details that you might forget when making decisions. But careful not to let too many small details overwhelm you though. Maybe checklists should primarily be used for risk-management, to check if you've successfully avoided all the pitfalls? (I think this is what Atul Gawande's 'The Checklist Manifesto' talks about, but still need to read it...)

##### --. (todo) Dynamics and movement of ideas: a quicker way to learn things?
For some reason I learn faster when thinking visually and spatially, with movement and dyanmics between my ideas. Is that because visually imagining the movement and placement of 'blocks' of ideas activates more parts of my brain at the same time? Or maybe because we're wired to work well with real-world, dynamic objects? 

##### --. (todo) Fragility, Compression, Redundancy and the Levenshtein Distance
In information theory and compression, if you compress a message too much and remove all redundancy, it makes the message that much more fragile and prone to being permanently unreadable after damage. (e.g. the word 'because' can change a letter or two and you can still guess what word it is, since it's long and has quite a few redundant letters. Its 'Levenshtein distance' to the cloesst word is quite large.  But you can't do the same with the word 'cat'. A single letter-change might change the entire meaning.) Similarly, is there redundant code in DNA to make sure mutations aren't too catastrophic? Also: maybe that's a sneaky marketing (or phishing) technique. Make your company or domain name very close to a common typo, and maybe you get more visits? free advertising.

##### --. (todo) Flow of electricity in the brain: Is it deterministic?
Electricity flows down the path of least resistance. Your brain (and maybe consciousness) works because of electrical signals. So does that mean that your mind just thinks of thoughts that sparked through the *path of least electrical resistance*? And so when you form neural connections through learning  (or addiction), is that just an act of carving low-resistance pathways in your brain? And how do you *choose* to take the more electrically resistant path? If electrical flow is deterministic...

##### --. (todo) Writing with blood (Nietzsche).
'Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood' - from Thus Spoke Zarathustra. How many of your ideas are actually yours? Are you writing with your own blood? Or, are you mostly regurgitating stuff that you've read? And if so, how can you take ownership of that knowledge? Will you test it in real life - under risk and uncertainty?   

##### --. (todo) Trading and investing ideas: look at mathematical derivatives and integrals, maybe. Instead of absolute values (y), what happens if you look at dy/dt? Or what about dy/dx? Or integrate y w.r.t. t or x, but with limited windows? ...etc

##### --. (todo) Inhibitory wisdom: Risk management and what NOT to do.

##### --. (todo) Inhibitory neurons: the 'corpus callosum' and modulation of neural signals. 

##### --. (todo) Investing in monopolistic businesses - Lesson from both Peter Thiel and Warren Buffet

##### --. (todo) Taleb's Barbell Strategy

##### --. (todo) What to learn: Knowledge vs Trivia

##### --. (todo) Uncertainty in limited doses: curiosity, serendipity, adventure...

##### --. (todo) Motivation and unearned dopamine in the morning; why you shouldn't listen to music until the evening.

##### --. (todo) Productivity Trick: Listen to the same song on repeat. What's the possible neuroscience behind that??

##### --. (todo) A set of highly related traits to work on: 'High Agency' (Eric Weinstein), 'Relentlessly Resourceful' (Paul Graham), 'Extreme Ownership' and 'Default:aggressive' (Jocko Willink), 'Aggressive Tinkering' (Nassim Taleb)

##### --. (todo) Procrastination as wisdom: Is your psyche trying to tell you something? 

##### --. (todo) Filtration mechanisms through opinions: The risks and rewards for being a polarising s.o.b. 

##### --. (todo) Measuring fragility of career choice: How many clients do you have? Sources of demand? Intensity of demand?

##### --. (todo) The Kelly Criterion: Bet sizes for gambling and investing.

##### --. (todo) Lying with Correlation: how can I lie with the simple, well-known measure of correlation?

##### --. (todo) Ethics and virtue as self-imposed constraints: If its not self-imposed out of a sense of self-respect, then is it cheap obedience out of fear?

##### 11. (todo) Wisdom as the sum of Courage over time
Sum up (or *integrate*) the number of courageous actions you took last year. That's probably proportional to the amount of wisdom and experience you gained. If it wasn't scary, then you probably didn't learn sh\*\*. <br>
And an extra note: Curiosity helps too. If you're actually curious about the topic, you learn much faster and in more depth.<br>
So, in a very nerdy way, it's something like: d(Wisdom)/dt = c*(Courage) + k*(Curiosity).

##### 10. (todo) Evolutionary attractiveness of the 'shadow': Why do people like Anti-Heroes and Femme Fatales?

##### --. (todo) A genuine question about p-values and disconfirmation of knowledge...

##### -. (todo) Disconfirmatory research papers - are there papers like that? 
i.e. 'We couldn't find any results that are definitely 'positively' true, but we managed to show that all these other possibilities are definitely NOT true'. Are there research papers like that? 

##### 7. (todo) The Need to be Activated: Brain regions and a framework for viewing emotions that come from 'lack of something' (e.g. boredom from lack of stimulation, loneliness from lack of connection, agitation from lack of action).
Just like your circadian rhythm cycles through states once a day or so, are there similar cyclical activation requirements in many parts of your brain? Are there parts of your brain that need to be activated once every few hours, or days? Is that the neural basis for emotions like boredom and loneliness - not enough activation of certain regions? Is there an activation requirement for the neural regions associated with aggression and competition? Do we all occasionally need something to fight against - an opportunity to commit acts of heroism or sacrifice? Or are we perfectly fine with comfort, cushy office jobs and mindless consumerism in the evenings? I wonder if this is linked to the accelerating depression rates and mental health issues. If Rafiki (and Mufasa's ghost) didn't remind Simba to heroically take his place in the kingdom, would he have spent the rest of his days feeling existentially anxious, playing video games, uploading instagram photos, and watching videos on netflix (or other *less conventional* websites)? 

##### 8. (todo) Viewing psychology through the lens of 'sub-personalities', and being 'possessed' by ancient neural forces that are much older and deeper than you. 
'You don't get angry. *Anger gets you*.' - JBP (Also: you don't get interested. Interesting things *capture* you. It's not your *choice* - you barely have any control over your curiosity. If you had full control of your interest, then procrastination wouldn't exist... You'd just control your emotions to become interested and focused...)

##### 6. (todo) Brain Hemispheres: Structural differences and consequences (esp. for processing novelty + uncertainty)

##### 5. (todo) Dopamine, Play and Hunting: Why do we respect wolves more than rabbits?
(The evolutionary basis of admiration and respect in social hunting animals. e.g. Wolves, Chimpanzees.)

##### 4. (todo) Interconnectivity and Systemic Risk: Pandemics, War and Economic Shocks

##### 3. (todo) The Idiocy of 'Hard Work': Why people who claim to 'work hard' are admitting slavery

##### 2. (todo) The Occasional Virtue of Arrogance: how else can you aim to be creative and contrarian?

##### 1. (todo) The Cheap 'Virtue' of Obedience: roots of totalitarianism and fascism.
