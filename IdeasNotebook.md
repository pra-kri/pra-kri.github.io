<p class="message">
  <b>A notebook of quick ideas, thoughts, mental models and reminders.</b> <br>
  Any time you read something interesting or useful that you might want to explore in the future, take note of it here. Otherwise, you'll end up forgetting it. Compound and structure your ideas here. 
  
  <b>Possible topics:</b> ethics/behaviour, neuroscience, risk, probability + statistics + ML, investing, startups + VC, thoughts on careers + work...etc
  
  For each idea: just a small paragraph, explaining <b>1.</b>the central principles, <b>2.</b>what to avoid (misapplications, risk), <b>3.</b>possible questions and connections to consider.
  
  Even if you only write down 1 interesting technique/idea/thought a week, by the end of the year you should have at least 50 decent paragraphs to think about.

#### --. (todo) What to learn: Knowledge vs Trivia

#### --. (todo) Cheap dopamine: Throwing your motivation away with unearned dopamine in the morning; why you shouldn't listen to music until the evening.

#### --. (todo) Productivity Trick: Listen to the same song on repeat. What's the possible neuroscience behind that??

#### --. (todo) Filtration mechanisms through opinions: The risks and rewards for being a polarising s.o.b.

#### --. (todo) How many clients do you have? A quick measure of the fragility of career-choice. Employment = 1 client, your boss = fragile to 1 set of opinions. Maybe that's especially worse in monopolistic industries, where you don't have competitors to go to?

#### --. (todo) The Kelly Criterion: Bet sizes for gambling and investing

#### --. (todo) Lying with Correlation: how can I lie with the simple, well-known measure of correlation?

#### --. (todo) Ethics and virtue as self-imposed constraints: If its not self-imposed out of a sense of self-respect, then is it cheap obedience out of fear?

#### 11. (todo) Wisdom as the sum of Courage over time: sum up (or *integrate*) the number of courageous risks you took last year. That's probably proportional to the amount of personal wisdom and experience you gained. If it wasn't scary, then you probably didn't learn sh\*\*.

#### 10. (todo) Evolutionary attractiveness of the 'shadow': Why do people like Anti-Heroes and Femme Fatales?

#### 9. (todo) The Unexpected Important of Speech: words affect life-paths much more than you thought...

#### 8. (todo) A genuine question about p-values and disconfirmation of knowledge...

#### 7. (todo) The Need to be Activated: Brain regions and a framework for viewing emotions that come from 'lack of something' (e.g. boredom from lack of stimulation, loneliness from lack of connection)

#### 6. (todo) Brain Hemispheres: Structural differences and consequences

#### 5. (todo) Dopamine, Play and Hunting: Why do we respect wolves more than rabbits?

#### 4. (todo) Interconnectivity and Systemic Risk: Pandemics, War and Economic Shocks

#### 3. (todo) The Idiocy of 'Hard Work': Why people who claim to 'work hard' are admitting slavery

#### 2. (todo) The Occasional Virtue of Arrogance: how else can you aim to be creative and contrarian?

#### 1. (todo) The Cheap 'Virtue' of Obedience: roots of totalitarianism and fascism.
