## Notes - 'Superperformance Stocks' Trading Notes

- [ ] Immediately after breakout: you want to make sure there's a sustained rally, and not just a short term rally. First thing after a breakout, you want to see **multiple days of follow-through action, on increased volume**. This is what signals institutional demand, as opposed to retail demand.
- [ ] Immediately after breakout: best indication that a trade will work well is when you're at a profit, immediately after the breakout, and stock follows through on good volume.
- [ ] Soon after breakout: Price pullbacks after a breakout are common and normal. Pullbacks usually last 2 to 5 days, and sometimes up to 2 weeks. If the stock has healthy demand, the price will 'bounce' back up, like a tennis ball. You want to find Tennis Balls, not Eggs.

* Start with an 'aerial' view, and slowly zone into to specific details. This is true both in the case of individual stock details, and also in terms of time-span.
  * For stocks: 
    * start by looking at fundamentals from a high level - e.g. Growth/Acceleration in Sales and Earnings
    * then dig in deeper and look at the actual **quality** of earnings and sales.
  * For time-span:
    * start by looking at the long-term trend - use 200-day and 50-day SMAs to determine if stock is actually in an uptrend or not.
    * then look into the short term base/consolidation. Is the stock price being pulled down by something? (e.g. recent market downturn)
    * then look at daily price and volume changes, to spot signs of accumulation vs distribution. Are large institutional investors accumulating a position in the stock?
