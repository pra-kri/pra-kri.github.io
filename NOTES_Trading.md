## Notes - 'Superperformance Stocks' Trading

Ref: Mark Minervini, William O'Neil, David Ryan, Jesse Livermore, John Boik.


- [ ] Immediately after breakout: you want to make sure there's a sustained rally, and not just a short term rally. First thing after a breakout, you want to see **multiple days of follow-through action, on increased volume**. This is what signals institutional demand, as opposed to retail demand.
- [ ] Immediately after breakout: best indication that a trade will work well is when you're at a profit, immediately after the breakout, and stock follows through on good volume.
- [ ] Soon after breakout: Price pullbacks after a breakout are common and normal. Pullbacks usually last 2 to 5 days, and sometimes up to 2 weeks. If the stock has healthy demand, the price will 'bounce' back up, like a tennis ball. You want to find Tennis Balls, not Eggs.
