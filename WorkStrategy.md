## The Fundamental Issue

I don't know any other way to say it, but you're an arrogant and lazy moron who thinks he can get away with minimal effort. It sounds almost admirable and impressive when you say that to your friends and colleagues - since you've achieved a fair amount even with the laziness. But it burns you up inside and makes you feel lost. Occasionally being reminded of your wasted potential doesn't feel good - it brings out that dull tinge of anxiety in your mind. It's not something you can keep doing. So start treating your research like a professional. Do the work.
