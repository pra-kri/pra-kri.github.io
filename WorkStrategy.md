#### The Problem With Not Trying

<sub>I don't know any other way to say it, but you're a lazy, arrogant, sheltered moron who thinks he can get away with minimal effort. It sounds almost admirable and impressive when you say that to your friends and colleagues - since you've achieved a fair amount even with the laziness. But it burns you up inside and makes you feel lost. Occasionally being reminded of your wasted potential doesn't feel good - it brings out that dull hum of anxiety in your mind. And worst of all, it's the same reason you disappointed your previous mentor who took a chance on you at his own company. It's not something you can keep doing. So start treating your research like a professional - do the work with some discipline and aggression. Laziness looks ugly on a young man.</sub>

#### Gambling with Obsession

<sub>There's a strange dichotomy with working: you have to really care about something, almost to the point of obsession, to do it well. But it's only when you don't care about the outcome do you actually perform your best - maybe because you're no longer scared of failing and screwing things up. You have to care and not care at the same time. </sub>

<sub>I think the solution to that is to gamble with your time. It's a bit like Tim Feriss' idea of doing '2-week experiments/ 6-month projects', and Basecamp's idea of '6-week bets'. Bet a limited amount of time to fully obsess over a project and do your absolute best to achieve something. But if your bet doesn't pay off - if you fail - then you only really lost that small time-frame. You can start again on the next bet immediately afterwards. </sub>

<sub><b>So, for now, bet 3 days at a time. For those 3 days, become obsessed with answering a single question. That's the uncertain gamble you have to make.</b> If the bet doesn't pay off - if couldn't find the answer in 3 days of obsession - that's fine. You only lost half a week of your life. Interestingly, it takes you about 3 days to read through a decent work of literature that you're fully immersed in. And 3 days is long enough to really understand the content in a good research paper.</sub>

#### Writing: Pride, Empathy, Craftsmanship and Expression

<sub> Writing seems to bring out the best in you. I think that's because writing forces you to create something tangible - something you can proudly stamp your name on. Knowledge stuck circulating in your head isn't something you can take pride in - no-one will ever see it. But writing, even if no-one will read your words, results in a tangible piece of work - something you can be proud of creating. Something you can craft and labour over. And maybe the chance of it being read by something brings out empathy too - it makes you try to understand the subject properly before expressing what you understand. Maybe that's why Feynman suggested that teaching is one of the best ways to learn. 
  
<sub>Or it might just be because you don't know when to shut up, and writing gives you free reign to express yourself for as long as you want. 
  
<sub> So, every 3 days, write an explanatory technical essay for ONE friend. I've found that writing to an entire group of people doesn't work very well psychologically. But writing to ONE person makes the words so much clearer and more authentic. (h/t Tucker Max)


#### Discipline and Aggression: 4 hours

<sub>There's nothing else to say other than this: hard work, discipine and aggression is respectable. Young men shouldn't be lazy and weak - that's pathetic. 
  
<sub>Every day, you are to dedicate 4 hours of intense, aggressive work on writing your essay, split into 3 sessions of 1hr20mins each.

<sub>Start at 10am, 12pm, 3pm. For the rest of the day, you should ideally still be obsessed over the question - but it should be low intensity thinking and mulling over ideas away from a desk.
