A list of essay titles that I'll (probably) never get around to writing ....

* **On Comedians, Lazy Geniuses and Counter-Signalling**, or the strange respectability of countersignalling, and the repulsiveness of pretending.
* **Time-Constrained 'Gambling' for Productivity**, or 2-hour/2-week/6-week experiments.
* **On Creativity and Contrarianism**, or when arrogant disobedience can be a virtue and conformity a vice.
* **Dopamine, Play and Hunting**, or why we respect wolves more than rabbits, and Eustress vs Distress.
* **'High Agency', 'Relentlessly Resourceful', 'Aggressive Tinkering', 'Default: Aggressive'**, or some advice from some interesting guys...
* **On the value of Constraints**, or why rebels and anti-authoritarians will always need a bureaucratic system to rail against.
* **The Odyssey, Hospitality and Trust**, or why you rise and fall to meet their expectations, and the social consequences. 
* **Information Asymmetry and Ethics**, or more concretely, how to respond to their 'salary' question.
* **Unconditionality and Ethics**, or why it's only an ethical virtue if it's unconditional
* **N-th Degree Knowledge Scaffolding**, or the value of re-reading a good book, and why writing helps you think.
* **How can you be proud of consumerism?**, or the blandness of most proclaimed hobbies and interests.
