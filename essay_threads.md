A list of essay titles that I'll (probably) never get around to exploring....

* **On Comedians, Lazy Geniuses and Counter-Signalling**, or the strange respectability of countersignalling, the repulsiveness of pretending, credentialism as socially accepted pretending, and the ethics of information asymmetry.
* **Time-Constrained Gambling for Productivity**, or 2-hour/2-week/6-week experiments.
* **Path-Dependent Productivity**, or why you should 'make before you manage'(T.Ferriss) on a daily scale, and why you probably shouldn't 'wait until you have more experience' on a yearly scale.
* **On Creativity and Contrarianism**, or when arrogant disobedience can be a virtue and conformity a vice.
* **Dopamine, Play and Hunting**, or why we respect wolves more than rabbits, and Eustress vs Distress.
* **'High Agency', 'Relentlessly Resourceful', 'Aggressive Tinkering', 'Default: Aggressive'**, or why it pays to know how to say 'sorry, I f\*\*\*ed up' in the most charming way possible.
* **On the value of Constraints**, or why rebels and anti-authoritarians will always need a bureaucratic system to rail against.
* **The Odyssey, Hospitality and Trust**, or why you rise and fall to meet their expectations, belief under uncertainty, and that one Solzhenitsyn quote about 'the line'. 
* **Tribes and Invitations**, or how you might get invited onto the team that you respect.
* **Unconditionality and Ethics**, or why it's only an ethical virtue if it involves a sacrifice; otherwise it's just 'obvious logic'.
* **N-th Degree Knowledge Scaffolding**, or the value of re-reading a good book, and why writing helps you think.
* **How can you be proud of consumerism?**, or the blandness of most proclaimed hobbies and interests.
* **Exploiting Fleeting Entropy**, or the role of temporary distortions and conflicting information in threat- and opportunity-detection.
* **Jensen's Inequality and Addiction**, or why dopmaine/reward uncertainty and the addiction mechanism might be linked to convexity.
