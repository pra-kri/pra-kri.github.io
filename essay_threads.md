A list of essay titles that I'll (probably) never get around to writing...
Mostly the topics revolve around applied ethics and philosophy: stuff that'll help me take risks and make decisions under uncertainty. 

* **On Comedians, Lazy Geniuses and Counter-Signalling**, or the strange respectability of countersignalling (wearing weaknesses as ornaments), freedom for those who care least about their reputation, the unattractiveness of pretending, the ethics of information asymmetry, and focusing on the generating process over the outcome (+ connections to The Iliad).
* **Berkson's Paradox**, or why your smartest members might have the least qualifications, the hot-crazy problem, and possible implications in stock selection.
* **Drowning in Noise** - signal vs noise, generator vs outcome, probability theory vs statistics, core principles vs details; saying no to almost everything, how to spot the quality of the generator rather than the noise, (connection to 1st essay...... )
* **On Gatekeepers and Honest Rejection**, or a salty exposition on rejection and when it feels fair, the ethics of gatekeeping in professional and social life.
* **How to Gamble Your Hours Away**, or 2-hour/2-week/6-week experiments, time as a currency for betting,'rational flaneuring', 'antelope vs field-mice', the neuropsychology of curiosity/interest, the 'orienting reflex', and how to bet your time on what matters; something similar to the Kelly Criterion applied to compounding knowledge over time: more frequent, directed bets and iterations ('aggressive tinkering') for more compounding, versus slow bets that take longer to compound; 
* **One Act of Creation**, or why you should 'make before you manage'(T.Ferriss) on a daily scale, why you probably shouldn't 'wait until you have more experience' on a yearly scale, and path-dependent psychology.
* **On Creativity and Contrarianism**, or when arrogant disobedience can be a virtue and conformity a vice.
* **Dopamine, Play and Hunting**, or why we respect wolves more than rabbits, Eustress vs Distress, personal sovereignty, and ownership of beliefs and actions as a 'measure of humanity' (N.N.T.).
* **'High Agency', 'Relentlessly Resourceful', 'Aggressive Tinkering', 'Default: Aggressive'**, or why it pays to know how to say 'sorry, I f\*\*\*ed up' in the most charming way possible, and why following instructions is the wrong way to succeed.
* **Polytheistic Discipline**, or discpline viewed as sacrifice, and how to use polytheistic ideas to motivate interest in the right sacrifices. 
* **On the value of Constraints**, or why rebels and anti-authoritarians will always need a bureaucratic system to rail against, the necessity of an 'arch-nemesis' (E.Weinstein's idea), and why suffering and evil are almost necessary for a good story (+ connections to Dostoevsky, Nietzsche and Existentialism...?).
* **The Odyssey, Hospitality and Trust**, or why you rise and fall to meet their expectations, belief under uncertainty, that one Solzhenitsyn quote about 'the line', and putting belief before evidence (faith, trust, hospitality, ..etc) 
* **Unconditionality and Ethics**, or why it's only an ethical virtue if it involves a sacrifice; otherwise it's just 'obvious logic'. And the thought experiment involving many 20th-century citizens...
* **N-th Degree Knowledge Scaffolding**, or the value of re-reading a good book, why writing helps you think, and why some researchers gain value from giving lectures.
* **How can you be proud of consumerism?**, or the blandness of most proclaimed hobbies and interests.
* **Exploiting Fleeting Entropy**, or the role of temporary distortions and conflicting information in threat- and opportunity-detection, 'waiting for uncertainty and using it as raw material' (Taleb, Antifragile), and Spitznagel's 'Dao of Capital' + Austrian investing, polyadic mutual information.
* **Jensen's Inequality and Addiction**, or why dopamine/reward uncertainty and the addiction mechanism might be linked to convexity.
* **Tribes**, being invited onto a team that you respect, risk and sacrifice and service, selfishly offering sincere value in your own way (otherwise, it's just obedience and domestication), how you might measure the value you offer, the unspoken advantages of networks and serendipity, the crucial end-step in Campbell's idea of the Hero's Journey, an exploration of 'localism' and criticisms of connected yet disconnected city-life...
