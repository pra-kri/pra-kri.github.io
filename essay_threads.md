A list of essay titles that I'll (probably) never get around to writing...
Mostly revolve around applied ethics and philosophy: things that'll help me take risks and make decisions under uncertainty. 

* **On Comedians, Lazy Geniuses and Counter-Signalling**, or the strange respectability of countersignalling, freedom for those who care least about their reputation, weaknesses as ornaments, the unattractiveness of pretending, the ethics of information asymmetry, and focusing on the generating process over the outcome.
* **How to Gamble Your Hours Away**, or 2-hour/2-week/6-week experiments, time as a currency for betting,'rational flaneuring', 'antelope vs field-mice', the neuropsychology of curiosity/interest, the 'orienting reflex', and how to bet your time on what matters.
* **One Act of Creation**, or why you should 'make before you manage'(T.Ferriss) on a daily scale, why you probably shouldn't 'wait until you have more experience' on a yearly scale, and path-dependent psychology.
* **On Creativity and Contrarianism**, or when arrogant disobedience can be a virtue and conformity a vice.
* **Dopamine, Play and Hunting**, or why we respect wolves more than rabbits, Eustress vs Distress, personal sovereignty, and ownership of beliefs and actions as a 'measure of humanity' (N.N.T.).
* **'High Agency', 'Relentlessly Resourceful', 'Aggressive Tinkering', 'Default: Aggressive'**, or why it pays to know how to say 'sorry, I f\*\*\*ed up' in the most charming way possible.
* **On the value of Constraints**, or why rebels and anti-authoritarians will always need a bureaucratic system to rail against, the necessity of an 'arch-nemesis' (E.Weinstein's idea), and why suffering and evil are almost necessary for a good story.
* **The Odyssey, Hospitality and Trust**, or why you rise and fall to meet their expectations, belief under uncertainty, and that one Solzhenitsyn quote about 'the line'. 
* **Tribes and Invitations**, or how you might get invited onto the team that you respect.
* **Unconditionality and Ethics**, or why it's only an ethical virtue if it involves a sacrifice; otherwise it's just 'obvious logic'. And the thought experiment involving 20th-century citizens...
* **N-th Degree Knowledge Scaffolding**, or the value of re-reading a good book, and why writing helps you think.
* **How can you be proud of consumerism?**, or the blandness of most proclaimed hobbies and interests.
* **Exploiting Fleeting Entropy**, or the role of temporary distortions and conflicting information in threat- and opportunity-detection, and 'waiting for uncertainty and using it as raw material' (Taleb, Antifragile).
* **Jensen's Inequality and Addiction**, or why dopamine/reward uncertainty and the addiction mechanism might be linked to convexity.
