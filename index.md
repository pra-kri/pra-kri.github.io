### Introduction
Most of my interests revolve around the central idea of **decision-making under uncertainty**. In other words: how should you act when you have incomplete information?

A lot of maths concepts (e.g. Entropy, Mutual Information, Ergodicity, Jensen's Inequality...etc) turn out to be surprisingly useful even in non-technical problems. I've written a bunch of essays and technical notebooks about these ideas.



### What kind of stuff do I write about?

| Topic | Question |
| --- | --- |
| `Statistics + Machine Learning + Information Theory` | Mathematically, how should you deal with uncertainty? |
| `Neuroscience` | Biologically, how does your nervous system deal with uncertainty?|
| `Ethics + Philosophy + Mythology` | Behaviourally and ideally, how should you deal with uncertainty?|
| `'Contrarian' Careers` | Financially, how can you reap the rewards for taking calculated risks and exploring uncertain territory? |
