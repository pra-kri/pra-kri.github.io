### What is this website?
Hi :) Welcome to my online notebook of ideas and thoughts. Most of what I'm curious about revolves around the central idea of **decision-making under uncertainty**. In other words: how should you act when you have incomplete information?


### What kind of stuff do I write about?

| Topic | Question |
| --- | --- |
| `Statistics + Machine Learning + Information Theory` | Mathematically, how should you deal with uncertainty? |
| `Neuroscience` | Biologically, how does your body (*especially your nervous system*) deal with uncertainty? |
| `Ethics + Philosophy + Mythology` | Behaviourally and ideally, how should you deal with uncertainty?|
| `'Contrarian' Careers` | Financially, how can you reap the rewards for taking calculated risks and exploring uncertain territory? |

#### Testing if MathJax works....
(need to edit \_includes/head.html to [make it work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26275645/how-to-support-latex-in-github-pages)...)

$$
  \bar{y} = {1 \over n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_i
$$


 {% raw %}
  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ --> note that all equations between these tags will not need escaping! 
 {% endraw %}
