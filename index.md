### What Is This Website?
A collection of **essays, notes and code** related to **uncertainty and decision-making** viewed through the fields of probability, machine learning, neuroscience, investing, policy and any other topics that I find interesting.

### The Central Idea: Uncertainty
This is the central idea that I'm curious about:<br>
**Decision-making under uncertainty. How should you act in the face of the unknown?** <br>
And how can you view this question from different fields?
