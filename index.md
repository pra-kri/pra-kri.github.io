### Start Here
Hi, welcome to my online portfolio of ideas - thanks for visiting! 
I'll mostly write about Statistics, Programming, Finance, Ethics and maybe some Neuroscience.
Since I'm mostly still an inexperienced idiot, most of the content here will be summaries and compilations of my favourite ideas from authors and writers who I respect. 

### A Bio
This is the part where I use credentials and institution names to condense information about my past.
Honestly, you can just skip this part - it sometimes tricks people into thinking I'm actually smart...
* 2014-2017: Oxford, BA Physics
* 2019-2020: Warwick, MSc Computer Science
Between those 2 degrees, I worked in a cryptocurrency trading startup (Python developer) and in an investment bank (business analysis + quantitative risk analysis).
After the MSc, I'm looking to get into Quantitative Research, or work with some Functional Programming.
