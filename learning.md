title: Mentor-based Learning

### 1. The Value of Knowledge
Some of the strongest lessons that I've ever learnt have come either from:
  * Personal Experience under Risk of Failure (much of which I end up calling 'mistakes' or 'learning experiences'...)
  * Mentors/Authors who you respect (and only *because* they take risks for their opinions)
  
In a way, knowledge isn't meant to be some sort of isolated, decorative theory to idly circulate in your mind. It's there to help you overcome real-world problems and actually *do* stuff with your life under risk and uncertainty. 


### 2. Information doesn't come by itself; Mentors and Real-World Problems
To put this all into more technical, almost information-theoretic, terms: **the message isn't the only information**. There is also information stored in the receiver (on *how* to process the information, and *why* it's useful, and *what* signals to look out for), and there is information in the transmission channel (the way the information is packaged and sent, and *who* is actually conveying the information, and maybe how they've compressed and de-noised their experiences). And these two extra bodies of information is what I think I'd need to focus on, to optimise my learning.

##### ::: 2.1. Learning from Mentors
Unfortunately, as part of one of my hilariously stupid character flaws, I've developed the inability to listen to anyone who I don't respect - both in terms of the 'knowledge' that they have, and the 'instructions' that they want me to follow ;)

Conversely, if I admire someone and their opinions, I've found that I'm insanely motivated to learn more from them, put in the effort to understand what they're trying to say, and keen on earning their respect.

##### ::: 2.2. Learning for the Real World
And another unfortunate character flaw, at least in the scope of academia, is that I can't force myself to learn abstract theory *unless* I have some real problems as a motivator. But the moment I've found some real problems, I'm more than willing to obsess over theory for 10+ hours a day. 

I have no clue what the neuroscience behind this is, but I'm willing to bet that having real-world problems might give your brain the necessary dopamine to get excited about the relevant theory. And under excitement, or curiosity, you retain what you learn *much* more. Maybe having a problem to solve, or an obstacle to overcome, puts your brain in that 'dopaminergic hunting'-type state where you're *looking* for opportunities and valuable information, rather than the prey-like state where you're just absorbing everything in case there's a threat.


### 3. How to Exploit This: *'Mentor-Based Learning'*
* **Pick a mentor** - Pick a writer/practitioner/mentor that you genuinely respect - someone with skin-in-the-game and practitioner's experience. Ideally, they should also be idiosyncratic, disagreeable and witty. You don't want to pick some boring low-aggression nerd.
* **Understand the problem** - Figure out what their central, real-world obsession is; what problem are they trying to solve?; what sort of decision-making skills did they pick up to become masters of their craft?
* **Obsess** = Now, for the rest of your time, obsess over learning what they've written. For the next few months of your life, they are (one of) your mentor(s), and their writings/books/lectures are your central texts. Read and re-read them as much as you can, really. 



### 4. Your Mentors; the 4 topics... 
* *GAMBLING + PROBABILITY THEORY* - ***Ed Thorp*** - 
* *HACKING* - ***Paul Graham*** - Learn LISP by reading Paul Graham's 2 books. Learning directly from him is much more motivating than reading some online course material, or even reading SICP. You don't know or respect G.S. or H.A.. But you've been highly influenced by P.G.'s writing for over 5 years - so learn directly from him.
* *STATISTICAL INFERENCE, and MODEL FAILURES* - ***N.N.Taleb, D.Freedman, E.T.Jaynes, D.MacKay*** - these are some of the most idiosyncratic and interesting probability-theorists/statisticians/information-theorists/physicists you've read. So just focus on learning what they have to say. Ignore all the other information out there - there's too much to care about.
