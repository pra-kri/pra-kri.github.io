title: Mentor-based Learning
---


Some of the strongest lessons you've ever learnt, and the deepest knowledge you've picked up, have come either from:
  * Personal Experience and Risk
  * Mentors/Authors who you respect.
  
In a way, knowledge isn't meant to be some sort of isolated, decorative theory to idly circulate in your mind. It's there to help you overcome real-world problems and actually *do* stuff with your life.
