<details><summary> <b>Strategy Note 4: 1 Week Bets: 1ch./1wk.</b> <sub>...(Read more) </sub></summary>
  Planning out what material to study on the side and which topics to master over the year seems too 'totalitarian' for your sense of curiosity. It actually makes you feel a bit anxious and imprisoned by your own stupid plan. In fact, your natural sense of disobedience makes you want to ignore your own dumb plan and pretend like it doesn't exist ('procrastination', they call it). That's probably the same reason why everyone fails their New Year's Resolutions: it's too totalitarian and controlling. A whole year of your behaviour is being forced to obey a decision you made over a single week or so. 
  <br>
  Instead, what you *should* try to do is: <b>Make <u>1-week:1-chapter</u> bets</b>. At the start of every week, choose 1 chapter's worth of material from *any* book or topic that you're most curious about. Your goal that week is to master the knowledge and applications of that chapter, and then write a 1-page cheat-sheet/guide for that chapter to summarise the core principles. 1 week is enough time to learn a decent chunk of material, but short enough that if you choose the wrong chapter and regret it, you only lose 1 week of time. That's about 50 decent 'chapters' of knowledge per year, if you keep it up. 
  <br>
  <small>(Inspired by: <b>1.</b> 'Shape Up', by some of the guys from Basecamp/37Signals; talks about 6-week bets when deciding what project to work on next, and <b>2.</b> the idea of the 'Rational Flaneur' from Antifragile.)</small>

<details><summary> <b>Strategy Note 5: Practice + 'Tinkering' > Theory</b> <sub>...(Read more) </sub></summary>
  Focus on building skills and intuition to build and research unknown ideas. Tinkering around and creating: that's the goal. Do NOT worry at all about theoretical formulae. Much of theory *follows* the invention that sparked the research. Not the other way round. The best researchers probably tinker around and invent things playfully and non-theoretically. <u>They usually come up with formal mathematical proofs AFTER the invention. </u> How else did they know what they were trying to prove? If you do not grasp the intuitive practical consequences of an idea, how can you formulate theory for it? By logically following and combining existing proofs? If it was that straightforwardly logical and un-playful, people would already have discovered the idea.

<details><summary> <b>Strategy Note 6: A Dangerous Quote on Procrastination</b> <sub>...(Read more) </sub></summary>
 <i>'One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea that doing great things requires a lot of discipline. Most subjects are taught in such a boring way that it's only by discipline that you can flog yourself through them. So I was surprised when, early in college, I read a quote by Wittgenstein saying that he had no self-discipline and had never been able to deny himself anything, not even a cup of coffee.

Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it's the same with all of them. They have little discipline. They're all terrible procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves do anything they're not interested in.'</i> - from <i>What You'll Wish You'd Known</i> by Paul Graham

<details><summary> <b>Strategy Note 7: 80/20 - Antelope or Field-mice?</b> <sub>...(Read more) </sub></summary>
  <i>'So ask yourself at the end of the day, 'Did I spend today chasing mice or hunting antelope?'</i>
  <br>
  An idea that Tim Ferriss talked about before. Are you hunting antelope or are you hunting field-mice? Are you focusing on chasing down the impactful targets and opportunities? Or did you just waste an entire day, week, month, or even sadly, an entire year, chasing nothing noteworthy?
