<p class="message">
  Notes and reminders: How should you spend time during your MSc? 12 months (Sep 2019 -> Sep 2020).
  
  <ul>
  <li>Mostly, you want to pick up knowledge to help you make decisions under uncertainty, and make independent, contrarian bets. The sort of knowledge that will help you take action under uncertainty (entrepreneurship, investing), and manage risks properly.</li>
  <li>And you want to become better at writing: <i>essays, research papers and code</i>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>



<details><summary> <b>Strategy Note 0: 4 Hours of Deep Work MAX.</b> <sub>...(Read more) </sub></summary>
  4 hours of intense focus per day. That's all you should be aiming at, and most days you'll probably end up doing maybe 3. Anything more than that is overkill. The rest of your time should be free to do whatever you want. 3 or 4 hours of intense focus is worth more than 10 hours of mediocre, unfocused attention.

<details><summary> <b>Strategy Note 1: Coursework > Exams:</b> <sub>...(Read more) </sub></summary>
<ul>
  <li> Term 1 coursework makes up **25.00%** of the degree. (<i>25! Important to do well here... 1st term...</i>)</li>
  <li> Term 2 coursework makes up **13.33%** of the degree. (<i>13... Can almost ignore...</i>)</li>
  <li> Term 3 final exams make up **28.33%** of the degree. </li>
  <li> Term 2,3++ dissertation is **33.33%** of the degree. (<i>33! Really important. Pick a cool topic then.</i>)</li>
  <li> All of this means: **70+%** of the degree is coursework/dissertation related. </li>
  <li> Which means that a deep understanding of the core principles, and writing code/reports/papers with clarity and interesting observations will get you most of your marks. *NOT* bland, mechanical, nerd-like memorisation of facts. </li>
</ul>
</details>

<details><summary> <b>Strategy Note 2: Knowledge > Grades</b> <sub>...(Read more) </sub></summary>
  You want knowledge that will...:
<ul>
  <li> Help you make decisions under uncertainty and risk. </li>
  <li> Help you self-reliantly take risks in the market </li>
  <li> Help you filter out the noise to get to the signal. </li>
</ul>
  Which means you should pick only topics that help you get to this goal: topics with lots of probability theory, information theory, machine learning and maybe a bit of complexity and game theory. Things that you are <i>excited</i> to learn. Otherwise, don't do it. Don't pick any topics just because they're easy. Choose them only if you're curious. And if there's a really crappy compulsory topic but it doesn't help you get to your goals, and it's only like 2% of the entire syllabus, it might actually be a good idea to skim it quickly and then ignore it. That'll keep you motivated with the rest of the course, and maybe you could spend that time on something more interesting, like a personal project, or something non-academic... Sacrificing 2% of your marks for a much more enjoyable year might be a genuinely good idea. Place your focus on curiosity and knowledge, not on grades.

<details><summary> <b>Strategy Note 3: The Unimportance of Almost Everythng</b> <sub>...(Read more) </sub></summary>
  Just because someone wrote it down in a textbook, or just because someone is *saying* something, doesn't mean it's worth focusing on. In other words, learn how to ignore useless information - whatever the source. <br>
  <b>From an academic perspective:</b> You've found that, in a 30-page chapter in a textbook, there are only about 3 pages of core ideas and value. The rest is there to just help explain the material. And once you understand the topic, you never read all 30 pages... if anything, you skim over and only really consider those 3 or so pages. So figure out what those 3 pages are. Fit those 3 pages of knowledge on a single sheet of paper. Understand the fundamentals, and pick up intuition behind the ideas. Then ignore the rest of the crap. Keep doing that for all the material you get assigned. To really instinctively understand how legitimate this claim is, think how quickly you'd be able to explain the textbook chapter to a friend if you understood the material deeply. Yeah, exactly - you'd definitely not need 30 pages for that.

<details><summary> <b>Strategy Note 4: 1 Week Bets: 1ch./1wk.</b> <sub>...(Read more) </sub></summary>
  Planning out what material to study on the side and which topics to master over the year seems too 'totalitarian' for your sense of curiosity. It actually makes you feel a bit anxious and imprisoned by your own stupid plan. In fact, your natural sense of disobedience makes you want to ignore your own dumb plan and pretend like it doesn't exist ('procrastination', they call it). That's probably the same reason why everyone fails their New Year's Resolutions: it's too totalitarian and controlling. A whole year of your behaviour is being forced to obey a decision you made over a single week or so. 
  <br>
  Instead, what you *should* try to do is: <b>Make <u>1-week:1-chapter</u> bets</b>. At the start of every week, choose 1 chapter's worth of material from *any* book or topic that you're most curious about. Your goal that week is to master the knowledge and applications of that chapter, and then write a 1-page cheat-sheet/guide for that chapter to summarise the core principles. 1 week is enough time to learn a decent chunk of material, but short enough that if you choose the wrong chapter and regret it, you only lose 1 week of time. That's about 50 decent 'chapters' of knowledge per year, if you keep it up. 
  <br>
  <small>(Inspired by: <b>1.</b> 'Shape Up', by some of the guys from Basecamp/37Signals; talks about 6-week bets when deciding what project to work on next, and <b>2.</b> the idea of the 'Rational Flaneur' from Antifragile.)</small>
