### Writing

* Writing, like programming, forces you to explicitly articulate and organise the thoughts in your head. Writing, at least for technical topics, is largely the act of articulating **procedural knowledge** - knowledge about procedures, steps and consequences.  

* And, a sad confession: it was only recently that I realised that mathematical symbols are the same thing. A mathematical equation is really just the condensation of *lots* of articulatable information, but into highly dense symbols. Until you understand the connections and flow between the ideas that you're talking about, you'll never be able to constuct or model a mathematical equation. 

* Writing, especially publicly, seems to bring out the 'reputation' part of your brain - it makes you care about how well you construct your ideas and how it comes across to external readers. For some reason, that feeling isn't there when you work in a scrap notebook, and that seems to affect the quality of your thinking. 

* Some of the most interesting professors you admire have all been *very* good writers. But maybe that's why they're interesting, to be honest. Richard Feynman, David MacKay, Nassim Taleb, Ed Thorp. And same with a lot of guys in the Investing and Venture Capital world - Paul Graham, Warren Buffett, Tim Ferriss, ...etc.
