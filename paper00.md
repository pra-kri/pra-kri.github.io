### Writing

* Writing, like programming, forces you to explicitly articulate and organise the thoughts in your head. Writing, at least for technical topics, is largely the act of articulating **procedural knowledge** - knowledge about procedures, steps and consequences.  

* And, a sad confession: it was only recently that I realised that mathematical symbols are the same thing. A mathematical equation is really just the condensation of *lots* of articulatable information, but into highly dense symbols. Until you understand the connections and flow between the ideas that you're talking about, you'll never be able to constuct or model a mathematical equation. 

* Writing, especially publicly, seems to bring out the 'reputation' part of your brain - it makes you care about how well you construct your ideas and how it comes across to external readers. For some reason, that feeling isn't there when you work in a scrap notebook, and that seems to affect the quality of your thinking. 

* Some of the most interesting professors you admire have all been *very* good writers. But maybe that's why they're interesting, to be honest. Richard Feynman, David MacKay, Nassim Taleb, Ed Thorp. And same with a lot of guys in the Investing and Venture Capital world - Paul Graham, Warren Buffett, Tim Ferriss, ...etc.

### 3-Day Essays - 001

* No matter what you do in your career, you'll be working on something difficult, and difficult problems always take over your life. 
* **Intensity and focus** - If you go work for a startup, building a useful product will take over your life. If you work for a hedge fund, the investment research and trading will take over your life. If you do R&D in any industry, asking questions and answering them will always take over your life. There's no real 'out'.
* **Problem 1: Enjoyment** - One problem with intense difficult work is that you have to enjoy it to do it properly. Otherwise, you'll find ways to fail and waste time. 
* **Problem 2: Velocity** - You also need to move as fast as you can, really. Otherwise, you'll end up wasting months feeling satisfied about working on a difficult problem, but getting nowhere - which is pretty pathetic if you think about it.
* **Problem 3: Social Pressure** - You like working with people, you like working on things that other people think is cool, you like earning the respect of people that you admire. Unfortunately, R&D type work is painfully solitary - even more so if none of your friends are working on the same thing. 
* **Problem 4: Identity and Expression** - You seem to hate that feeling of losing yourself and forgetting your emotions. If you're feeling a certain emotion, you want to be able to incorporate it into your work. You don't want to have to repress your emotions until the end of the work day. Sounds like slavery. If you can't colour your work with your own personality and emotions, it feels too 'autistic' (no offense mr zuckerberg).
* **Problem 5: Having nothing to show** - A month after learning something, you usually forget that you've learnt it - even if you understand it now. It falsely makes you feel like you didn't achieve anything.



I think the solution to all of this is to work on a 3-day-essay-based schedule.
* Every 3 days, pick the most interesting question you want to answer - a question that if you answered, would move your life forward in some way.
* You don't have to spend too much time thinking about the question - you're only gambling 3 days on it, and being decisive quickly and effectively is a good skill to practice.
* Now that you've decided the question, for the next 3 days you're going to write all about it. 
* Specifically, you're going to write the essay/paper as if you're writing to a single person. Write personally - that way you can colour in the writing with emotions and maybe some slight sarcasm... And it feels social as well, so it tricks your brain into activating empathy.
* And the 3 day limit gives you the pressure you need to work fast without indecisively questioning yourself - which you're prone to doing...
* And writing 2 essays a week will give you a good collection of past work that you can look at, to see how much you've learnt.
